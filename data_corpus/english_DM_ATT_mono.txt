 i mean, i feel like i'm way too midwestern <$> like i would feel rude doing that even if the time was up, i'd be like okay, we need like a natural ending to our conversation 
 they're all like that that jack in the back of american stuff <$> well that would suck 
that's not an issue <$> like relatively speaking, we can handle that 
 and she said it varies at different times <$> like in the morning most people are wearing masks, but by the evening most like 50% of them aren't 
um and then i do a lot of uh a lot of stuff with their school for for my son's school <$> well he's got two years his junior so he's got two years left 
have you ever worked retail during christmas <$> oh yeah, that's the worst 
 yeah, but yeah you learn, it's good to get like one roommate that knows how to cook and then you kind of learn from them <$> oh yeah, yeah, she loved cooking, so that was great, mm yeah, pretty much 
i played, i played him once <$> well not with the controller, like on the computer 
 have a good day <$> oh is it like a san or like a test 
i mean i do it by choice <$> like i you know, do a two week rotation 
 that's nice talk with you too so <$> oh all right, thank you 
oh that's that's horrible <$> well uh mm, mhm 
 what when was that <$> well that was pre 9 11 then 11 happened 
you can tell me there's not something wrong <$> well she tests fine with this i said but can't you can't you have an issue with a certain type of of like her as she was word problems 
 no, i'm not sure um if that is true or not <$> well kind of stay tuned for a couple more weeks and see otherwise then i'm gonna got to find something else 
 all right, that's great <$> well you have a great rest of your day 
 so i'll be seeing you then <$> like i said, i wish you the best of luck 
 or oh is even more than what we pay, they pay like $8 for a jug of milk in los angeles <$> well i was trying to move and i was trying to buy a house that was going back to pennsylvania because i lived there the longest in my life 
 okay, i'll go back to that one <$> well it was 97 
 she don't think so <$> well me, i'm like, listen all those other people who did tax evasion and stuff like that, they ended up in jail 
 mm and yesterday it was so windy <$> oh my god, it was crazy 
like i already give you an answer <$> like i said you can hang out with lily because like it's already hard for her to hang out with her 
 so what brought you to like doing like this <$> like i'm assuming you went through prolific as well 
i know how cool <$> oh yeah you were 
it's like were you able to find this part of the website really easily <$> like could you navigate this 
mhm oh, i see, that's ok <$> oh wait, i probably should 
 i feel like we're like from different countries here <$> like there should not be that many differences by produce market 
um but there are all of the people there like so many people figure out ways to make money that are very unusual <$> like there's this one kid like 12 year old kid would wake up every morning early in the morning and like just troll along the beaches, collecting anything 
 that's kind of where you make all your money <$> oh god, it can range anywhere from 60 
 and i've been there for basically yeah 12 years now <$> like i worked for 80 mts like u verse like cable internet phone support 
that's not having my mom <$> well she actually did lose it so it's justified but she like she just said it was lost and they're like okay, no baby am 
so um yeah, i don't know <$> well it's like we'll probably just like drive around and look at things but we can't actually go do anything 
 uh to be honest <$> well i see again i mean i lived there a good long time you know 
 no mass protests that i'm thinking <$> oh man, that was just so terrible that so many people actually are hoping that something that this would happen here 
um well people call it upstate is technically western new york, i'm like an hour and a half from buffalo <$> well right now i'm actually close to buffalo, i travel a lot for work, but yeah, that's where i'm at 
 can you do you <$> oh if you hold on sure 
he is very much a uh he he and his mom are similar in how they travel to, they're both super easy going when we're in luxembourg <$> like you know, you know this from being in spain on sunday everything's closed, you're just supposed to take your siesta, you're just supposed to relax and chill 
and um what's wrong with me <$> oh and salt lake city in utah a lot of people, those are the four state capitals that have city and their names 
you know when i was there about two years already and i had heard a lot of things but but never seen anything <$> well so i think i dominated the conversation 
and to i don't want them to know where i am <$> like i just see social media as like another way for the government to track me 
i wanted to match that lady first <$> well first how can you be so stupid like uh and then the poor dog, everything i had what to be 
 the economy has gotten a little better <$> well until this happened, his attitude is just and i like that type of deal 
 um and yeah that's about in like other school trips and stuff <$> oh new orleans, new orleans 
 so but you know, she's well taken care of it and everything now <$> oh and she's diabetic, i forgot to mention, yeah, it's just like every year something else happened were like great 
 yeah risk that they take every day <$> well that's good the whole stripping down and hold them off 
 there's no money here <$> like they're going to have to solve the business because there's absolutely no money and but the 81 year old still wants to spend, oh my goodness 
 yeah, it's a lot they're like very active though <$> like the husky fix their working dog used to like pulling slaves and stuff where their ancestors are like, i don't know, 50 or 60 miles 
 uh what you like and vitamin whiting <$> oh my god you're still using that stuff 
 what's the temperature like there <$> oh my gosh, wow, okay, i'm not here to just go out 
 and ok dokey then <$> oh get it down when you guys get home 
 yeah, every time i go back it's completely different <$> like downtown austin, i don't even recognize anymore 
honestly, like to me, i just don't understand how people even get up there for the most <$> like horses are huge like randomly 
 oh no no no i was just curious <$> oh is he this easy 
but like, you know, that's your sense of smell <$> like what the heck is 
 he was doing like a video job <$> well he was trying to do a video job while talking 
 but i mean there's been a few <$> oh it was austria yeah that's what i said 
yeah, things are interesting <$> oh yeah, it's very weird to watch her, like you look at your phone and see a photo of like from six months ago 
yeah, i think, i mean i think that's true and kind of archaeology in general <$> well and actually all of science, there's a lot of stuff that we overlooked in the early history of science because nobody thought that it might be important 
 what even is the world right now like <$> well there's so many things that i don't know anything about and they're so weird a lot of times 
 i've always been a big hater <$> well especially midtown manhattan and the other parts i like like the other parts are more brooklyn and like that's gross but too long 
 what are you into <$> oh your question again 
um is it true that georgians <$> well i guess they say it is about southerners, but are they just sort of like more outwardly friendly 
 yeah, that's oh yeah <$> well it's very much the whole, you know, if you go to save a file, like in most programs it will be a floppy disk image, like no one 
 once the chat window is open, timer will appear here on the survey pay <$> well i didn't see no timer 
um come towards winter <$> oh wow see how levine 
 i would i think he's a terrible position himself <$> oh you saw how he was breathing when he got when he got the road up 
and you can accept the jobs that you want to do <$> oh and i'm in washington by the way 
 yeah there isn't much <$> well i mean i guess there is something to the los angeles but i mean it's not much also los angeles 
that's how i feel like yeah, drink <$> oh yeah, i mean during the semester it was easier 
 but at the same time, well it's more about my country <$> like there were many problems 
 it is only to me wonderful <$> oh i just took two trips this summer 
 yeah, it was like well i've been had no uh them when when they when they act like that <$> like i can't even be mad at you now because like firing me 
like my nieces and nephews for example, their school is completely shut down <$> like in their county no schools are open 
but in vegas the rent screw up the flights because people couldn't make it to the airport and timer or something happened the night before <$> like the crew timed out because of the rain or something strange happened, remember 
 so you had to put a fringe out there <$> oh my god, before the apocalypse 
 she's a frontline worker <$> well she did like a frontline working gig because she's qualified as a nurse 
 you said your name is tammy <$> oh great yeah i can hear you better 
can see if you can <$> oh yeah it's pretty, pretty cool 
 i can hear it like a teeny tiny bit <$> oh now i don't hear anything 
 um uh christmas next month <$> oh yeah i love it 
 um but it's this large web of just ridiculous <$> oh and one other thing, so about like a year and a half after our daughter was born 
we are teaching them to hate a group of particular people at the end of the day, like that's not, we don't want people to hate <$> well at least for me with this whole movement where we shouldn't be teaching 
i don't really actually dr yeah, thank you, thank you <$> oh good hurry up 
i can't help it <$> oh yes, no literally they will do anything 
 no, it's not going to be still near that i wanted, but hopefully there's going to be some kind of trick <$> well there's already some treatments, not 100% effective but at least 40% effective 
i'm like, oh my gosh, like what, you know what is going on and what if the dogs are out there <$> like how we're gonna keep that from happening again 
 but uh the high, well the one i went to the high in atlanta, the one that has the, it's a, it has that thing <$> oh my god, what is it called 
yeah but oh yeah yeah that makes it nice, you know you have to work <$> oh my gosh people it's behalf they're like we're just erin we're gonna book a whole month fight for anybody else right 
 oh looks like you can hear me what <$> oh good good good 
 exactly and then you do <$> oh yeah yeah it's all about just yeah it really teaches you like help with money adds up so yeah crowd content and amazon mechanical turk check those out 
 you know, they're always pretty much a judge you based on your first impression and never find that and i feel like the first impression doesn't really matter <$> well this is like a professional standard where you're trying to get a job or something 
 i don't remember buying much but we went there a lot <$> oh yeah what was weird to me 
 i would not want to learn how to drive there <$> like being, being in an uber in new york city gave me so much anxiety 
 i think we started like 502 so we're good <$> well it was nice meeting here 
i mean, it just depends <$> like i know for mturk i use a lot of those scripts 
 so she has to still go out every sunday uh to the church <$> like even though there are only like eight people there, like only dog master and some of the musicians 
oh there you were <$> oh hello let's say you started up three area 
 and now i'm helping like i spend my evenings doing note cards <$> like say i was doing it yesterday on some different art 
 but i was always inside most of the time <$> well let's probably go to class 
 so it's like i worked in the early shift today <$> well i'm gonna go spend a couple hours after my shift 
 that bite is so like with the kids <$> well even i've heard one news of arizona that in one day care it happened that so many kids bought in practice 
he said, oh you just used my bank account <$> well no, it doesn't work that way 
 and then there's so many stories that are like that, they're pretty crazy <$> like there have been, you know, like there was an illegitimate company that was using amazon mechanical turk to get people to do your captures for you 
 yeah, it really would have <$> oh my gosh, i am 
 i have a nephew who lives in minneapolis <$> well he lives in um, apple valley 
 like they always complain about their food <$> like i just hate working with customers 
i've been here for about seven years, lifelong <$> well almost lifelong resident of new york state 
 yeah, the wind spreads are about 15 hundreds <$> well i'm saving up for a long time, so 
 i did a few when i was going to school <$> oh are you, are you in a dorm right now 
 how were they what were they eating <$> well they're just eating like pellets 
 these are cheap minor <$> like the frames are like 12 or something like that 
 like, i think it's worth cleaning up like going so hard to get new stuff <$> like how long are we gonna be here 
 and then there are some that are like through museums <$> well where they'll walk you through all these like displays exhibits 
right look up world of goo mm that's it <$> well so the premise behind it is you there's this fun story and you are using you have to put together goo blobs to achieve something 
i went to school in tennessee <$> oh and i grew up somewhere else 
 like i don't know how to do it <$> like i just find it like an interesting like i lose, i lose fuckers, i lose patient 
or just being i got home <$> oh yeah, it's crazy 
 your, hey, i thought you were supposed to be back until tomorrow <$> well i wasn't, but wow 
just get to sit like when you're working on campus is like one of the staff members <$> like it's go go go and contact every student, check in with them, make sure they're okay 
 because it's like my dad was like if you're not in school right now then you're not going to have a job <$> like you're either going to be in school and have a job or you're gonna do neither or you won't live underneath my roof 
 wisconsin is getting crushed right now with scott <$> oh yeah they can really hit harder because you know if you think about it there's probably right now probably the cold estate in the in the u 
you can thank me for it <$> well you can thank me for it, but enjoy it 
i mean he's he's his own breed <$> like the guys create like when you put the two plates a little bread on that girl's ear and made her call himself an idiot sandwich 
well we're not hanging out because i've had to sink telling me like six times but we're not hanging up <$> well we're getting 25 minutes out of this 
 it's like i like somewhere more than winter <$> oh that's that's only part of winter 
yes, i've seen it <$> well i started watching it but i just know i got up to like five 
 how old is your daughter <$> oh god, it was so cute 
yeah, they wanna, they wanna get island before they come in <$> well get it out 
uh oh are you there <$> oh i see it just a shadow 
 i'm not really much of a leader <$> like i'm a team player since that i'll help out 
uh huh oh yeah <$> oh mhm mhm oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
 you gotta make a little bit of money <$> well yeah, i'm second home 
 and my wife would be fine one day and then she'd go out so we'd phone i said did you spray <$> well we don't have to tell you that 
how old is he <$> oh but that's sort of fun 
 every state is so different because i've done a couple of years as part of another assessment <$> like they had another round of this 
 yeah far better than this so that i could actually understand what you're just saying <$> well uh whatever it is uh wish you will go up 
 you can't, everybody just thinks it's it's worse than along because long you kind of know you fertilize it and you're done <$> well there's another thing when you fertilize, make sure you don't get any fertilizer in the pool because it will leave iron 
what about the tactics <$> oh uh you can say 
i mean to be honest back, what <$> well you eat, you want to know what happened 
 so i get a little frustrated and a lot of people are like, ok we'll go get a job <$> well my husband's disabled, he had a motorcycle accident three years ago and his back is broken in 13 different places 
to this day i still get like, we're like, i'm getting it right now <$> like weird chills or strange chills 
i'm all about it <$> well then, i think we're almost up 
 there's no matter what the coin, there's always going to be a court <$> well you would think i do 
 do you know if it just ends or do we go back <$> oh yeah, because i know we have to answer that snoopy, but does it end by itself when it's done, do you know, at 25 minutes or whatever 
 they had a group to play um shop <$> oh i play too but i didn't even know the rules but just the boy tall and then hit the ball but i don't know 
 and don't don't get me saying that <$> well if we teach the kids how to social distance in the school do social distance at home, i'm like really 
you know, i want to like the last chapter of dracula by bram stoker and i never finish it <$> like i was like, i'm done with, oh god, like it's just not good 
they said it's not that bad <$> well for like my friends it wasn't that bad because you're standing up so you don't really feel it as much 
we get these like i'm sorry <$> oh do we get these like cactuses and stuff and i can never keep them alive 
yeah, it's just it's amazing because you don't really like, well even now like everybody has to be kind of more in their own little bubble <$> oh go out there and like enjoy everything as much as you, you know, you yeah 
 how do you keep contact <$> like keeping in contact with the people in your network 
 like i don't think anything they're going to come to play football at all <$> like that's just ridiculous 
what will, you know <$> well you know it's you know uh so biden from delaware 
 it was played yesterday at the cotton bowl and and there's always like split right down the middle <$> oh you fans in texas 
and so i stared at it and i'm like, this is really hard <$> like i thought it was like not that i was smart but like i thought i could like get these 
 i think i went to read it and found that and i put it on here and then it never told me anything <$> like i never got any notifications if it's the same one, i don't know 
yeah they've been limit lenient with that <$> oh and another thing the t 
 yeah that's what i just said <$> well why couldn't i have studied just a little bit more when i was 18 that would have made my life i was 30 or 34 so much easier 
 learning is so important <$> like my kids are being taught to cook full meals, not right this minute, i feel like i'm teaching them elements 
we went to like a small little mountain town once though and people were not good about it <$> well i couldn't go anywhere 
 i think just people are getting really frustrated um everywhere across the board <$> oh hello cat, cute 
 and now his whole campaign is all about him being like so strong <$> oh my god, i think i was on youtube and it's so funny the political as if they showed me 
 are you hanging on for that for how you hang on to that for like keepsake or you plan on selling it <$> like what's the move with that 
but yeah and it's like what was it <$> oh and and then like, you know, more than likely the tuition is not going to change even if we go online, so 
 what are you supposed to be doing <$> oh well, thank you 
maybe do you have it on your phone <$> like link to your phone 
 i've worked at factories, call centers, bookstore, assist manager of bookstore back in the nineties when <$> well there he is my boy 
 that's super gracie stuff <$> like i'll never understand it 
oh, make oh my god <$> oh my god, i'm so glad that you will have your time enjoying for the evening 
the tipping you talk were you like um go on the water up there though, isn't it <$> like freezing perhaps over 
the other night there was uh i woke up the next morning unfortunately <$> well i didn't wake up until five a 
no, it was like it was like something interactive <$> like we want you to interact with the system, you know, talk with it 
 it's much more like that <$> like everywhere bungalows have a lot of bungalows, which are really cute 
 so it might not always be like a blanket <$> like if they have a five star rating, you're going to like them or not 
it's too like my daughter <$> oh school is not there 
 it's got to be like breaking into somebody's house right <$> like a famous person's house 
 but like, i don't know if they're going to like change it or like revoke their decision or something <$> like i'm like, i've been stuck at home for like since like march 
we get to the campus <$> oh you live in dorms 
 which which level are you <$> well she knows how she's, wow congratulations mm i'm happy for you 
 wonder woman, i like, i like the first movie and everything but her birthday, we had already been planning a few months ahead of time <$> like we're going to go out to dinner, go see wonder woman as your birthday 
 oh my gosh wow <$> well i'm just gonna stay indoors all day long if we just get a little bit moving there 
it was very fun <$> well good luck with your degree and the nice weather 
 have you seen people in, what's the temperature like where you're at <$> like i'm in the 90s 
can you imagine if it was different <$> oh we want to be in lockdown again 
but yeah it's really fine <$> oh my god, i love indian food 
 where did this come from <$> oh my gosh, i had an opportunity to buy that property when i was younger, why didn't look at it now 
it's not really the same i guess <$> like there are a few times where i've been at like a music festival and i'll go down to the forint, which i don't really do 
 i mean whatever, some people just aren't team players still could eventually, they'll find getting too hard <$> like i never win 
maybe it was like a freezing type thing, like award <$> like they used rewards 
 so if we don't change the parents knowledge and their style, then the kids are going to change <$> oh no, it's it's such a it's such an obvious correlation 
 where you calling in from <$> oh i'm i'm in california to i'm near san francisco yeah closer than most of most of these uh conversations i've done 
 and i'm also not good at statistics <$> oh my gosh, i'm terrible statistics and i had to take 
 i'm a huge beatles fan <$> like you can tell me a song 
you flew to reno <$> oh man, what's that like 
 the only time i got like actual security was when i was coming back from morocco on the ferry was only actually checked into my stuff <$> well a lot of times a lot of people smoked hatched from smuggle hash from morocco 
 um just a pure guess i would say <$> oh man, probably like 25 years my guess 
yeah, it's and yeah <$> oh it's but mhm 
 my neighborhood sucked for halloween <$> like nobody put up lights like it was so lame 
oh yeah, yes, yeah <$> oh my god, i'm sorry 
did you ever figure out how to like move past that <$> like how do you ever figure out how like do you just let the pain stay until it goes 
 thank you for that <$> well she takes that's good, wow 
 it's not helping it just because of the flow traffic <$> like the construction project is not even five minutes away from over here, it's always five years behind that, you know, that's how it typically goes 
what is a frantic anthropologist do <$> well did i let get that done people and figure out how they die 
 so i yeah, i really haven't same with me, like i haven't had time to do anything <$> like i've just been consumed 
 it wasn't like smith or something, you know, we're okay <$> well maybe you cross reference and got the wrong person but no 
you know what i mean <$> like i couldn't just discount one place 
 yeah and michael jackson beat it came on today for me the way you make me feel remember the time <$> oh my god my blue came on usher and alicia keys come on now i'm impressed 
 i thought that i thought they were just like, they were all like, what's it called <$> like owned by like the manager in that area 
yeah yeah mhm mm <$> oh yeah yeah i can see it 
 and what about the people that are like really old and sick <$> like how how can they feel comfortable going in voting if there's lots of other people 
yeah i think it's i think it's pretty similar <$> well i think you have to write the essay but i think it's pretty similar like, if you, if you meet the minimum standard, you're in 
yeah you'll be good definitely <$> well hey we should be good i think with the time so i appreciate it 
 what are you doing the cat <$> oh she's my uncle, she's got sony's 
oh man let's spend a long time <$> well who was the first, who was the champion that came out when you first started playing 
not in my city <$> well it's like 20 minutes away 
 you know, that's just commuting it <$> oh well i guess i can close the box but we gotta go back to the end of the box anyhow 
he got, he would be nuts <$> like he'd be bouncing off the wall like a ping pong ball and you don't even think about it 
 they're opening up quite a bit like the restaurants and stuff are open again <$> like i was going to walmart and the applebee's was completely packed like around, i think it was like the fifth or sound, it was insane 
 so what brought you to washington <$> like what was the impotent 
like we go in big groups were losing children <$> like i personally like dressing up like we dress it up only five 
 it's very like i live above a bar right <$> like it is very like kind of busy and like not really residential, but it's not like i said, skyscrapers 
and that's the first company i tried is um as a mary speak that's that's the first company i started working with <$> oh you know what i forgot to tell you one opinion you can try that one as well 
well, yeah, yeah, of course <$> like my grandmother doesn't know what that is 
 i think it's half and half <$> like you can go to school if you want or you can learn more, you can do it at home 
yeah, but you live in new york city so isn't it i mean <$> oh okay, trump mm mm but that's not too bad 
 can you hear me <$> oh uh i can't hear you 
i'm from originally from a really small town in northern new york, it's like up on the canadian border <$> well i mean nothing much really happened there, but yeah 
 um where are they going with this <$> oh yeah, maybe it's just are sort of i guess my generation and your generation
