# so family # um # familiarity and # um # just the community i think
# it was on national news # you see i'm # not that informed on that um *
# i i uh # i would find that hard to believe * # personally
# along the lassie line and uh * uh leave it to beaver
# uh * i've thought about that it's sad i'm # i've * i mean *
# no # it was during school * um * you'd go there *
# i picked um legal secretary also # but i chose law enforcement over that because i got accepted to that too
# yeah uh my brother didn't know what the heck to do with a check book
# um they just got different beliefs she believes * # i mean like # one thing # she believes all men will cheat
# yeah she's got # she's got * a lot of kids * * there's um # three boys and
# um * i first of all couldn't be her friend
# well i think they got that all off of um # * the tv * i mean # that influenced #
# * # well right now um # i work third # third shift # at a # men's wear *
# * um i'm sort of in # upper clintonville * um # *
# um getting out more wouldn't help those * # it's um # ah
# ah # i have i've have # uh # and yknow there kids in the neighborhood and *
# * uh # three years # something like that # hard to remember * * *
# * well i don't know the people that i see * around * um * yknow they're grownups
# yeah um you're * you yeah you may be right # could be # could be # i never thought of that
# i think so # i think so * um # it's
# um # * of # course we would all hope that abortion wouldn't be
# um i'm a pre art major right now hoping to get into computer animation
# um # i talk to him every now and then # yeah
# yeah um # i've grown up here all my life so it really hasn't shocked me all that *
# * it i # * i don't know how to tell you that um * i mean it it
# * * * it would be nice but no * um * *
# um * actually i think it needs to probably start younger than that
# um maybe i better clean up my act * # *
# * um # a lot of online # magazines # music magazines # that kind of thing
# * uh i would # either go back in uh # languages * or # actually i'm a psychology * * * yeah
# uh # well i think * because i went abroad i had # basically one extra quarter beyond four years
# right * um # at the age that they were
# um # * # not really * # because i think # yknow
# um # you'll # i i just got back from # a year in england so * i'm not sure about the new
# actually they're they are working on it i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt you uh * um # they've *
# they've um just instated some bonus schemes where * as
# um # yes i * haven't they talked about that here actually * have they talked about
# personally i think it's a good idea i mean uh # i * i mean # to me # yknow
# # uh a little bit # north of north broadway # right along the freeway there
# well # yeah it's # i just give you a rough # estimate of uh # two and a half miles from here
# # it seems like it # just about everywhere on that street is uh # one way or another criminal #
# uh # me see # the a section # goes back in # um-hum
# so where were you out of uh # # overseas
# and uh # well football games we won't even start with that *
# # i uh # i make side # little side # bets # not # necessarily money
# so i kept my one dollar and uh # got a one dollar added on
# yeah so uh # things pretty much in columbus public schools yknow they don't # they don't actually sit down with # you
# and he really did go on to uh # study about that # myself # cook # *
# * # no it's just uh # regular old # rent a cop
# i mean i hear in new york city where it's # a lot more # populated it's uh # getting real bad
# but uh # the smaller town i went to southeast of georgia # or uh # atlanta was really great
# # yeah they're gonna # most likely raise it up to twenty one # since all these uh # the *
# think a little bit safer idea # than uh # eliminating guns # because yknow there's always gonna be weapons out there
# you could set them up in uh # some kind of
# # and a lot more um * different suburbs so maybe it's * it's going and * becoming a little wealthier # and
# uh # * which # which the the as far as the the * # violence
# trying to cut through and see what i can do # and uh # yknow there's just ah
# just under # december ninety five # uh # the day the last day
# yknow there's no prioritization in the legal system # there are some things that uh should be addressed
# * which meant that uh # the judge granted them an additional year # of discovery
# i don't wanna have any of this printed or anything * yknow it uh *
# * # * # and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people
# see * and and i * i uh i * i don't understand that mindset i really don't i don't know why
# but uh # the mansfield branch campus for o s u's there
# um actually yeah we live on an we live on an # now we live on an eighty acre farm # yeah
# um * i'm a * i'm a christian i go to a non denominational church
# some of the really hard questions # um why do bad things happen to good people
# and uh # it's just a matter of # i mean # i
# i think there are * i think there's a place and a time # for doing certain things # like um # *
# and this is # this is one of the biggest um # things that people use as * as a reason for
# and there's # it's # believing that uh you're doing # what you're doing is right
# got plugged in there and i met someone there # um # in
# but um # i've been single since # * uh # probably # march
# um one time # * i read somewhere that # a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby
# and uh # i bet i couldn't pass the * i bet i couldn't pass the math without some * instruction
# i started the school year off with uh * twenty seven kindergarteners # and # no aid
# um hum * # maybe we're beyond that # we shouldn't * always be saying * *
# oh yeah # well # i don't know * # um *
# it * it just seems like our # uh society just has that # you have to
# um hum * yeah # yeah * * okay *
# * um # that's our planet # um hum hum hum
# uh uh uh # i have one daughter thirty six years old # she lives in toledo and then i have two grandchildren
# uh # i don't know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but
# um # but it's not that i it's i don't like it as well as columbus # at all *
# okay # i have two * * two um students # my one she's twenty six two # two *
# it's not the materialistic things that the university here * # uh # professes to be the thing
# uh just really # not # extraordinarily different food necessarily but just # just really

# well the furniture the dining room sets the the uh chairs the couches
# oh okay okay # uh yeah as far as the siblings go bernie is uh does charitable work

# * * where are * uh * where you from you say
# but i had i liked the long hair it was uh # back in the sixties so yknow
# uh * not as much as i useta be when i was younger
# um-hum * the reds uh # more so than the indians back # my younger days because they weren't worth a damn but
# i remember when i was married my my ex said do you want go uh # shopping
# i live at um one sixty one and cleveland area # in an apartment up there
# shit and # i just started uh # screwing up
# so they wanted to # put me on probation and my uh # rebellious attitude or whatever said # i quit
# i see it like on the bus or with uh yknow when you're working somewhere and uh where you
# i remember one time when we got in a big argument one time when she uh # when she turned teen # teenager
# # # well uh here # yeah # they gave us ten thousand # here's a dollar
# they were just visiting yknow they weren't there to uh stay yknow
# want that i want to get a uh # a spiritual bookstore yknow
# in the wrong * it was just wasn't the right time and uh # * # it just
# uh a bookstore just # * # down around campus yknow and
# yeah something the # coffee uh # doughnuts yknow or
# that wouldn't happen again # uh # talk about all that shit for a while but
# * uh i live up north * um # around carl and # uh morse road # * so i have a house
# oh # a place on some land # with * woods and uh * yeah * water things like that
# uh * five years ago almost five years ago couple months # short of that
# yeah so they adjusted that but then they didn't have any way to * um # enforce that so
# um probably not * # * he thought it was great that i was going to school but
# but uh as far as being a leader or something like that he i know i don't # i'm sure he wasn't
# when he died # um # i was about thirty
# uh he had an anorism # he had uh # high blood pressure
# i ended up uh # running away from home * yeah # i was a teenage run away
# um # so uh # that's what i did and i
# went to some uh # foster homes and things like that
# * and uh # lived in delaware for a while
# uh # it's not gonna get better it's gonna get worse yknow with the way families are torn apart now
# the runaways * uh well * i think the youngest that i met was maybe * * but that's yknow still young
# he had been in uh # he was only about
# and my son he's uh # he's a senior he's twenty two he's a senior here
# he does uh real well in school # he's uh # like a honor honor honorary thing yknow
# * but when i put him on the ritalin he was um # laying on the couch yknow just # zombied out
# * so he uh # agreed to go to psychiatrist and uh # so he went on ritalin
# * # his doctor um # doesn't believe in # ritalin
# i don't have a good opinion of # uh columbus schools # at all
# now # i live down the street from what they call c.a.h.s. it's the columbus uh alternative # high school
# * # and this child is only uh five years old
# and uh # i'm telling you # some of these principals # that
# uh principals driving big fabulous cars and # not doing anything
# * # my # son uh # * # yknow with his disorder # * # he would constantly be uh # late
# * # and i uh # called the school # and told them # this was in high school
# and uh # so he knew he could get by with it
# she was uh # see he was tenth grade and she was ninth grade i guess
# i i was really glad that my son uh met yknow was introduced to them or brought in or whatever they do because
# so it's just uh gonna be a matter * rearranging # he's # um * applying for another scholarship he gets some already
# yeah uh somebody's gotta get # k get # yknow # put george bush to the back # # #
# uh doesn't think that your politicians should be bought # yknow
# i was interested in uh seeing # uh coleman be elected yes
# because # uh * * # * she's a republican
# * uh i used to work with * * # #
# * i would call her and she would um # * uh just be really rude # not helpful
# * i felt that uh # yknow # polaris # mall would be good # for the city
# um # * i can understand yknow the residents of northland
# uh * # wanting their mall to remain but i didn't feel like yknow that had anything do with polaris being built
# * # um # lot those i don't even go to
# it's been good for my son # uh being here at the # university *
# i'd say * uh nineteen seventy three # * # * one sixty one
# and i would uh * # like * # yknow
# * uh to get up there because of transportation # issues
# # not really # um i'm # more into # like # more beat beat oriented music # like
# she uh has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that
# uh i was only there for couple weeks in the harbor * i never set foot on land
# uh because i wasn't allowed to wear jeans i wasn't allowed to wear tennis shoes
# course everybody else could but * basically what it was uh * was a weird situation in high school
# uh it was for me and a couple other people and that was it
# well he's uh * exporting cars illegally # yeah *
# * uh you're in a high tech society and most people you said you're from new york right # your family's where *
# uh * # that's what i mean it it's too easy to get away with stuff nowadays
# uh * it's just # there we go again who's right who's wrong i have no idea
# most the * i have # uh i got one neighbor that hates me and he's a sheriff
# uh the exercise i do a lot of walking anyway and swimming and stuff in the summer so
# uh * i did have a white kid my son living there and that's about it
# no no um * there's a few townie bars but college students aren't real welcome there * so
# * yeah that's uh # the the bureaucracy # it'd be too much of a struggle i think
# um * like # khazakstan and # i mean not really near but # relatively it's not close to moscow *
# yeah uh she might know * her name's * she's um # on the school board # *
# yeah # * need to pay the rent * * * that's # um yeah *
# there are some um # foreign activities classes or foreign type culture classes or foreign understanding * # yes
# # um # wander around look at things # talk to people # yes #
# so am i # * * um # i missed your question before that
# uh she's in my class # yes # # yes #
# * uh * all the conversations * had about * since then lead me to believe *
# like # completely broke out of traditional gender roles i # also like deep space nine in that * # uh *
# uh fawcett center so it's # it's not even really on campus # yeah
# uh essentially all the big academics most the * # uh * it's actually * all over the world it's international
# no we # we haven't # uh * yknow there's always that * uh but we haven't *
# yeah it can be a problem uh if you get hit
# uh no that's okay * ya know don't * i just don't want to touch it i just
# uh it's a high school * * trip * uh she's in eleventh grade
# it was columbus # he went to uh fort hayes
# yeah well * um * i think the teachers are every bit as good as dedicated but i think there seems to be
# i don't know i hadn't thought about that # uh * # *
# uh # you know it's she said it's scary going into the classroom sometimes # *
# * # and so she had some of the medical problems when she emigrated and # * * uh it was just
# i uh i've gone to one but i had a back problem that's how * dealt with it * and it worked
# uh # and it but again that's i think part of that too is society's not ready
# * uh usually whatever ones i can find uh * hey you got * columbus alive and *
# just not quite that # yeah the local ones more than anything * uh * #
# * # uh but the dispatch # the only reason i get the dispatch is i do wanna know what's going on locally
# * and a statistic under * any # * uh any # definition really is nothing more than an average of some kind
# that's just because it's in the name of government # they're suspicious and uh # *
# * yeah * my uh * # my brother in law was very much opposed to any kind of gun control
# * right * # yeah * it's uh well you're right *
# * he uh i guess he always did take things a little on the extreme
# * # * * uh * all focus changes it really does
# but it's a uh * smaller catholic school yknow within * # saint louis so *
# mm-hmm # i work at uh * * company plus i help out at the b v a vietnam veteran's association
# um # no not really i mean different cultures and everything uh * but
# * i wish i knew the answer uh # but
# turn the turn the music up and it's already blasting you know uh # um hum
# * # uh this is my senior year i'm graduating in june
# uh or a student or is it a student visa or is * as a tourist visa
# so will you be * like a waitress or * or uh uh clerical
# uh * * shaky * okay * not too many dot coms apparently over there * # *
# uh i no # i never i never looked into that but that's a good suggestion
# * you have * * yknow like yknow * the # * * * uh * typical american * tourist
# yeah um the medical school has pretty much limited them to ten percent of the
# * yeah um i took one oh four # during * # winter quarter * #
# * um i've been there twice already * # # yep #
# um both times # i stayed around this little town uh * it's like northwest of munich
# so it's southern * um mossberg # # # oh * you know of those areas
# um # i like how everybody's just a little more relaxed about stuff
# * no they don't actually # um # it's kind of funny you're allowed to drink before you're allowed to drive
# * and um # apparently when you're a car # um they have a very very # * like zero tolerance
# * # yeah they do um * # i think it's something like sixty percent
# uh they give us the domain name and all that
# * # we have uh * yeah we have # typical dorm room #
# um it was cheaper i was getting money on my buck i d * # so i actually got paid every day #
# yeah we have a little kitchen # uh i've learned a lot about cooking # lately *
# uh business like that but * it's a private business they need to be able to
# um yes some of the guys from venturing crew live there *
# uh it's # it is where bioinformatics was about a year or two ago
# yeah he's teaching us uh system five * it's *
# um * * both of them are older * my * like twenty seven twenty eight and my brother's twenty four
# um * probably would've been about six years ago * i'd been in * sixth or seventh grade
# uh my dad is remarried # um * * # probably been married for * four or five years
# um * not really i mean * i've been with a few people that have
# um # a few * that they did * # specifically * * um homosexuality # but
# um * there weren't a lot but uh there were definitely
# i think for the most part people could handle it # um * obviously i think probably more *
# um i met her in high school # she's still in high school and i'm in college # so
