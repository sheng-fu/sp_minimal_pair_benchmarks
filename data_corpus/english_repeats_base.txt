You have to put your education on dote on on delay like this right from spurs actually sunday
I I kind of kind of a blended together in my head though # so
Yeah still still does something that's not just flat
I'm a longer than smartphones # That's my my line
But yeah # once it's on your # like # once it's there there forever
No no no I don't but but I think I like that kind of scenery in that lifestyle
Yeah # Yeah # Yeah # Okay # Wait since your Vietnamese do you you eat far # Right # How much is the good Bowl of Father
Like I I just I don't know it doesn't give me positive feelings for the future
Do you understand # So that's that's a theory
Mhm And you're saying heat mm mm
I do websites and apps and I'm I'm studying to be a a machine learning developer # Now that's like statistical programming
I didn't say that I did six months traveling Southeast Asia # And it was uh Thailand Thailand Laos cambodia Vietnam
Um and the individual ones that make me no more or less about # so that's that's kind of what I do um mm Yeah
You know # you're you're trying to make the decision and it's impossible to know what people are doing
Mhm # Oh yeah # Yeah # you need to be protective gear all all throughout # Mhm
They are not supposed to do that because if they have their their egg sac on their back they can explode
And like if you have a dollar or two # you can donate to the theater blah blah UCB did none of that
Yeah # Yeah # I mean what what age level do you work with
Yeah # Right # I I have done a pretty good job of not doing things # you know
Right right right right
But it's it's difficult because I just couldn't believe the bank could do that like all through sign
So the way I look at it here is what's what's going to a public place
Oh goodness # So the test # is that that big long q tip of your nose
So I had this wild theory that that they would basically sacrifice the lower class and that everyone lower middle class and above would be fine
Perth yeah # I think you probably just going to close the X on the tab and and the survey will stay I think from what I remember
I mean you know it's so melodic and uh and just just gorgeous # I just love it
It's like # okay # Exactly # So don't don't worry about it # But it was great talking to you
Um So it's it's interesting # but like I said that # you know # that's all I've ever known # so # you know # to me

Yeah # those those are the ones that are interesting # you know
So I I have a degree in political science and history
Yeah # the east Coast are able to grad school on the East coast and then then # uh # it's a different mentality

Like that's that's an interesting pattern that's emerged
Okay # I'm I'm one of three # but grew up with another 2 #4 foster kids Catholics
But it's it's the right mindset though # especially you know you've worked all day to get this opportunity and you're not gonna blow it

I've not not made it to India # unfortunately # I'd love to love to go there sometime as well
And Yeah # I mean # I I feel that we are dangerously close to getting into a political argument at this point
I felt terrible doing that # I was like I I just have the emotional intelligence of a goldfish or something
Um but there's still like amazing beaches and like forests and streams and like yeah amazing amazing wildlife
That'd be so cool # Maybe just just uh ah alas price
Her enemy # I hear you # But your your video went okay

Yeah # so you say you're you're in community college right now or you're going to school or teach
No that's when he said that it was like like once in a while it was supposed to be for two majors or whatever
Like as as soon as they opened the restriction of like # hey # we may go back to work # like guess what
Like for example they say walmart usa wants to buy or needs to get some some dishes on the made in walmart china or something like that
I I would they didn't have to pick like this or that
Yeah so its borders Canada and uh us it's it's in Buffalo # in the Buffalo area
Uh all of that relies on knowing somebody being lucky who is lucky in in the first place
Mhm Yeah and and it wasn't really fair # I mean common core # I'm I mean I'm not too familiar with common core
Um My mom told me about it and I've just been doing it and I've made here let's see I've made $85 euros or their pounds pounds so far
Uh huh # Oh wow wow # that's That's helpful # that's really helpful because see with my social security the only money I get is $760 a month

Okay # Well what's what's your first name
Mhm # Yeah I I work a lot I work a lot but and I have my dogs like a 30 only 30 £35
Uh no scorpions are real big spiders and and all of our snakes are harmless
I don't know uh I don't know how to stay what what what else comes to mind I guess
So I was I was very surprised that that that Houston was such a diverse city and it's like I said it seemed like I had a great culture
So a lot of these things will say don't don't tell anybody # you know # two proprietary or information
What's your course course load this year or this message
Okay # Was it for for a good reason or something that you didn't want to stay # Okay
Yeah # Oh okay I'm I'm about 3 #5 hours away from there mm
They're kind of segmented off and sometimes you get a little break # but echo # it's just like you go go go until you can't go anymore
Yeah that's that's news to me # this is this is great # Um mm Since the pandemic have you noticed that you're eating healthier or worse sir
Exactly # Uh No # no # you go ahead and because I'm changing changing tack
Mhm # The one thing I uh no no you go ahead
But You know now I look back and go man at 30 # I wouldn't have even that would have never crossed crossed his mind or my mind
But it sounds like you you understand like like the mm uh Yeah
So when it's to visit # it's always Minecraft Minecraft Minecraft # I told him I got a job working on a video game
So it's it's not like we're doing the same thing every day # although some same thing
This coming right # It's like like the square
Um So it kind of makes sense to stay stay in north Carolina I think
Right # Yeah # Yeah it is out here is too too expensive now
Yeah # Uh And no thank you # Well right no no I'm happy to continue living here # I I think it will too
Yeah # Yes # so yeah I kind of became a a little weather expert although I've never studied it
Uh But well that was one of the things when when the shutdown first happened um because we live near Shenandoah National Park
Yeah # because I have used a prolific notify their before and and it used to have one that was on something else and then whoever supported it
But uh you thank thank you thank you
Yeah yeah but yeah that yeah mm it's it's been it's right and yeah okay of course of course yeah
Oh yeah # So by the time you're like 30 navy # she'll like like another another nine years and like you'll be # you'll be there
15 years # 14 years not old # but it's it's old relatively
We have the the time is up # All right # It was good to meet you and good luck with school
So this this is pretty cool # so I'm excited about this
Um But yeah # we we just handle other things
Do I hold out for somebody who can really keep up with me # But like it's that's that's rare # right
Yeah uh he's he's all right that that is easier
I I saw it was it was good # It was better than the last one that they had done but it was a little silly at the end
He's # what is his character's name # He's the really um one that doesn't understand sarcasm # Drax Drax drugs
And so it makes it it makes it kinda helpful # That's the one I do a lot
So uh if you're in California is are you still on a stay at home order or or what's the deal now
Um That goes goes pretty well # It's I think they said it's the largest independently owned movie theater in the U # S
But yes they are far far away from most of everybody and everything so
Okay # Fabulous # So in the summers you you live with your parents then in the summer you go back to the dorm
So yeah # it's it's weird # right
That's right # Yeah # I mean it feels like we'll have herd immunity before we'll find the vaccine from from other
Um but So like there's like this like nationalism that kind of comes out and they're like # I mean you're you're 100 # in American
Oh yeah yeah I've got I've gotten I got a few trophies
Our # for me it's it's um yeah # don't put your hands Alexa # I have to put lotion on them
All right # I'm going to click it and see what happens if if leave then goodbye
Oh Oh # come home
Mhm # So to to make the uh it's a small world even even weirder # I work for A # S # U
Yeah # I mean it's it's like $17
So I I spend a lot of time reflecting like pensively gazing out of windows he like right
I I think so
A girl can go out and and function you know # with her new family # with the husband
How about you # How how long does it take to become a software engineer # You know what that's no no
It's been ice cream # It's ice cream # How can you hate any type of flavors of ice cream # Uh huh No it's it's two distinct flavors
You just have to have the will will power
Um So it's it's a lot just one dog
So our our company is like uh we like develop new drugs and stuff so we actually do the distribution part of it
Mhm # Yeah # Yeah # No # I I agree
Yeah # So it's been interesting # but I mean they're both they're they're amazing
Yeah # Mhm # Yeah yeah yeah can can be depending on where you are
Yeah # And # and very quickly to for for the scientists like # yeah # it's crazy
No # I'm gonna reach out of my comfort zone for the extra extra moolah
Mhm # Mhm wow wow
It's like there there are dozens of us # you know # Um Right
I mean # and at least biden is listening to him and and so yeah and I love Warner too
I I did one this week that was it was like also clearly about # but it was more of the like um I think it's called Game Theory
Um Yeah right now I'm about I think like two hours south of the falls it's it's uh I've only actually been there once though
Um That's like I don't know # I feel like it was against freedom of speech but but yeah
So that that makes sense
Yeah or you doing for like like like a year and found nothing
Like the main difference maybe maybe in like a parking ticket in Warsaw is going to cost you X
Yeah # Mhm Mhm Right
Yeah so so what do you do you know what you plan on doing your psychology and neuroscience
So you know # all things considered not not too terrible # Yeah # Mhm # Yeah
And so # you know # but I I we don't expect here # um # for this us to go back to work until this june
Yeah Nathan # It's called Talk to a game or at least fucking yeah yeah yeah we're getting paid for it so I know
That's that's that's a it is
Yeah # Yeah # Mhm # Yeah # I mean everyone's looking for different things # I'm sorry # That's why Wendy # Stop you go go go down
And I'm guessing by by your reaction you don't pay that much ran out there where you're where you're at
Yeah my my laptop was not working
So I I usually start these things by just doing an introduction # And would you like to go first or would you like me to go first
Uh I hate missing out on it # but it's it's just for the best # Uh huh
Yeah I just haven't had the the money or the time probably um there for the start doing this
So we were like yeah she's she's blind # she's lost her
Yeah very very pretty # Uh it's very tropical down there so
And then it slowly changed where like more and more university started adding their experiments and surveys into it # including including research into artificial intelligence
Both # I mean you you got a pandemic right now right
Yeah # Yeah I've got that for for chrome # Yeah I use that
Yeah # I don't live near near any sand area really
And I was like # you know what I I just I give up I got I got nothing
Also like another reason like uh like they have to communicate with with a lot of partners if they have like you know 5000 or something
Um Yeah yeah yeah # I'm in Chicago
Uh huh mhm mhm Oh uh huh mhm Uh Alright
So I'm actually I'm from New Jersey # so very close by but um it's still still a fair drive up this wall
Thanks # Is it look look
Uh I do help create instagram accounts # but I don't put my face on it # don't you know # I'm I'm uh non existent # right
Um # oh # Nevo Nevo
Yeah I'm sure that's not popular with the oil industry either you know uh because I've been out of there yeah yeah and they don't like it
I'm on my last week before payday and right now I'm saving up for for christmas
And like the only reason I know what's being discussed is is some of the teachers are flat out like so prepare for that because it's in discussion
But yeah # so do you have any like plans for the weekend # are you gonna gonna go out and do something or
Uh huh # Yeah and you study on on the side # you do that and study at the same time or how does it work
Yeah # Okay # Um # I don't know # is there anything like that that you like # Is there anything like unexpected that you like to do
Uh Yeah # yeah yeah yeah mm # He said she was in med school right # Yeah
That's yeah # I I know a lot of people are doing like uh huh Hello
It's great talking to you and stay stay safe out there
You know what something that that might help you # that helps me in those situations is imagining that I'm talking to a friend
Yeah that's right yeah my my senior year # so for a little while longer I am
Yeah # Yeah # I will not not be experiencing that anytime soon
Do you know um Take a white white teacher is minor

So obvious Florence Florence
Problem uh pork it # Yeah yeah stressful you know Yeah they're they're like this and the dogs are
Okay so you you have a good night man
Uh So I just kind of do it whenever whenever they have enough students for it so
I mean The second tournament had prepared for and stuff and and again # six place in 3rd place
Okay # Mhm Oh yeah # I I just tried one yesterday and there wasn't anybody there
