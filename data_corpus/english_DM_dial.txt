okay. okay, awesome, awesome, awesome. okay.<$>so even when the kids and i were home and quarantining, he was still coming and going every day.
you can't do this online life.<$>like my daughter is a freshman, she missed out of this mothballs.
yeah, i will, i like it.<$>well keto will welcome you with open arms. that's fine.
yeah and it's just ridiculous like. okay. yeah.<$>so i can pretty much like if i only live with hispanics, i'd in their eyes look ghetto.
that's a very cool industry to work in.<$>so have you have you always lived in minnesota or and other places?
i never really paid attention to currencies. so i'm learning that but 100% i'm huge into investing.<$>so you exchange it right at the right moment? right off.
right that's a good idea. mhm.<$>but so far no luck with that. but we'll see.
mm hmm. really, wow.<$>well maybe that's why like it's like, i don't know, like easier to deal with that one.
all right. yeah, i do that. no, decided to.<$>but that's really cool.
uh huh. yeah. uh it's very um here is very different than so especially the way there.<$>but the philippines, yeah. how did you end up in the united states?

yeah the art museum is great.<$>so we kind of made ugly.
so from 66 to 74 like that. that was actually our new record for raymond james stadium was 74,000.<$>so yeah, you guys got a lot to look forward to.
that's unheard of. uh huh.<$>but yeah, definitely nothing over 15. and i was like so where? yeah.
is that kind of what it is? it's actually all, yeah. mm.<$>so we have like four activities that teach them different stuff.
i would guess. like it's a, i watch a lot of video game stuff, so, yeah.<$>like people play games are like, oh, do you like 80?
it's like, look at these strangers trying to have a conversation and uh, worst first date ever or something.<$>so sir? uh mhm right.
i would not would not. yeah.<$>but like my only problem was just i wouldn't attend class.

mhm. oh that's fun. right. yeah. uh huh. yeah, no it's fun.<$>so pretty excited so yeah yep.
it's actually closer for me to go to mexico.<$>well because new york is the bottom the most is the southeast tip of the state.
mhm. unless we do. okay. all right. so this microphone is really can be really quiet.<$>so mm it sounds great right now, how are you?
mhm. mhm, mm hmm.<$>so yeah i guess cut having as few registers open.

it i've been to pittsburgh, i haven't been to kenny berg, kenny, kenny one.<$>because we have kennywood park? many would, yeah, yeah, no and mhm oh oh wow.
mhm. that is unfortunate, clever that could happen.<$>so i think we're good.
yeah. well currently i've been just sitting in my desk all day long.<$>well when you're not when you're not in covid, what do you do?
yeah, she's just i don't know by okay right?<$>but also sometimes i'm like why do you keep texting me good morning, like thank you. but also why?
mhm. well, and he was alarmed.<$>but um my sister, yeah he was 53.
mm hmm. yeah. yeah. yeah.<$>so it is, it's like, i, you know, i try to not think about it.
right. yeah. mhm. yeah.<$>so yeah they left everyone normally you have to live on campus.
i meant the main island. all right.<$>but you know, i know they can do that though when it's not when it's not too volatile.
the stakes are low. yeah. all right.<$>so i think we're both like, yes, new blood.
yeah. mhm. mhm. yeah. oh yeah. yeah.<$>so that's what we did. so i got them tested.
that's terrible. this whole year has just been crazy. do you? yeah. mhm.<$>so now we get to enjoy the masks.

yeah, actually, but then i go to walmart, nobody's wearing a mask, so that's fun.<$>well strange times. yeah right now.
yeah. yeah. yeah. mhm, mm hmm.<$>so it's cool to just like hear them talk about like the stunts and stuff that they did.
oh no, you just have more insight because you're a writer, honestly.<$>so i i spend a lot of time reflecting like pensively gazing out of windows he like right.
so you want to be open before thanksgiving.<$>well and you can get i guess after being established at that post christmas christmas day puppy mm yeah.
oh yeah, yeah. cool. mhm, yep. yeah. mhm mm. yeah. yeah, you have. mhm yeah.<$>so now with covid, it's again like you really want to do that, you know?
