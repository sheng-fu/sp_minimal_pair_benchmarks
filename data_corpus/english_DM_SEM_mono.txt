that's what i wanted to say <$> but i didn't say, i'm like, yeah, that's my dog 
 so um also a prosecutor in korea is like the person who prosecutes the case but also investigates it <$> so like it's and it was like a lot of work but also it's really, i don't know anyway 
and i tell them why the hell aren't you <$> because it's not magic 
and that's what i did <$> then this pandemic hit, like, it's insane 
 i think it's fun at the people i've met have all been awesome <$> but you know, there's there's nothing that i can think of 
we're making much more money off the unemployment <$> then they were making up their job and i was like that i didn't get any 
 they always get knocked out of the ring really quick <$> so i don't, i don't, they don't ever make it very far, but they don't, it's really weird 
 i think i'd check that out <$> but i don't i don't think i got approved 
 how do you go <$> because you're not communicating again or you just see it on your face 
so then they booted me then <$> then i just randomly, i was watching some youtube video and some guys talking about mechanical turk 
 why would you do that to her <$> because it was really cute 
 uh just pretty much just like laying down my bed in the morning <$> but my time i'm always like, hey let's just go pump some blood now running around because the james say hi to people 
um but that also like my plans that we kind of got dampen because of covid too <$> because i'm like, actually start doing it 
 no, i don't, i don't think there is a right way honestly <$> because you know, if they asked creditors this question, they would just be like, i would play with my wiener 
so i keep thinking how lucky i am because i was thinking of like not doing grad school and just going directly into the workforce <$> but i think it's better that i'm here because i probably would have gotten fired and i was working 
 i think it was 50% 1 week and then 25% the next <$> then they changed it again before they paid us and they said okay we're gonna give it to you for three weeks 
i wish i would have known just to communicate better especially with just how great everyone was there <$> but it wasn't needed as much as other parts of japan i think because it was so like so much of an american presence 
 it doesn't really accurately reflect it <$> but some of those are pretty, pretty, pretty funny though because they're like, they give you this oddball question and this implicit bias test 
 so her steps was, hey, i'm gonna let my mom know my dad, no, like grandmothers know <$> then she went ahead and she downloaded the center app to make sure center knows what she wants 
but when i looked at all of this like none of it even added up, even if you sold it for a higher price <$> because for example i got um i wanted a new switch because i like the original one so i want, what was it like april or so when yes 
we've been uh like, yeah, obviously not in school <$> so it has been um just like doing surveys to pass the time pretty much 
i'm smelling, i got you <$> but it's like we, we, we live in a world like covid has given people an opportunity to do something that they've never done 
i'm a little jealous <$> then i had organic chemistry pretty much all day 
um well one, it's like a plucking instrument instead of using a boat, you have to plug each sound <$> so like, i don't know how to like is there a western 
 i don't know if anyone is doing good in the us, we're doing better relative to other states <$> then he's slowly opening things up 
 and so they work for super ultra rich people and they have to plan every single detail and uh things that i would never know about it <$> so so they have to be super ultra x 
 your grandma can't do this <$> then we stayed inside 
 oh the did you notice an increase in volume of work online after the beginning of the pandemic <$> because i personally have experienced uh have been like positively benefit i mean in general i guess 
like 27, 29 and minnesota has 10 <$> so like if i look at that, i can get an idea of how, what our population is 
he made this thing, he made a wireless electricity device and he tested it and it worked <$> but people like edison took over and they squashed it 
 like i don't know if ups and fedex just lobbied so strongly to like put the post, there was completely out of business <$> so all of our male has to go through private companies, but it's pretty sad 
so it's nice because it's all special ed and it's smaller classrooms and in a public school <$> but it's super weird because there's no direct instruction or anything like were there, but like it's all computer based learning 
 so that's why i asked, do you believe in that <$> because i have encountered people who are like best why nothing is happening 
so that's why i took the lights and went around <$> but i'm gonna start hot gluing stuff tonight and i got some purple bats and so i was like, i do, i do crazy stuff 
 like when they have saint francis or saint joe's and i felt like they treated people better <$> so i was just wondering about that 
 and he's worried about you if he wins this election <$> because i know many republicans are going the other way 
i'm like but the one thing is that you have to use your all your own paper and all these things you're not getting remember for any of it <$> so that's one of the downsides 
so like he said, what i have now is better than what i could get down there <$> so yeah, so i gotta put my son a lot of good use, you know 
 like i'll probably just wait a year and then reassess and try to reapply or something <$> but it worked out, so 
 like i also like creative group costumes and be cool to like have like two of their friends and do like snap crackle and pop from the rice krispies <$> because like, i don't think like, i don't know if anybody would recognize him though, but just be like once somebody does like mm hmm 
 we're going to a lot of mental health, a lot of years of people dealing with depression and addiction issues coming out of this in my opinion <$> so it worries me 
yeah takes a while <$> but part was my fault i could have gotten the citizenship much much sooner 
do you want to sign up for that after you get through that <$> then you get on where it's just you know and you can change the email how often they email you 
so i was like, so we watch movies like at our own houses <$> but we'll start at the same time and we'll text each other and move 
 how is, how is that side <$> because i think recently we are talking about texas um if we if we can move from here to texas, i don't know 
and he's trying to read his book, which is like a history of denim, right <$> because of course, that man does a little bit of everything, which is part of the character 
 um and i actually laughed with my dad a lot because he says i overthink things right, because i got this one as a kitten <$> so i'm trying to make sure i do all the right things right 
 like my skill set is like validating data, you know <$> so i i like the idea of being part of the recount so we'll see what happens 
yeah, it's just kind of hard like to stay consistent with it and to actually like, you know, set a schedule <$> but i'm working on that, you can see like you see the lamp back there, and then there's like some clothes on the table 
oh well that's good <$> but um yeah, i just feel like because of the circumstances, it's just not been good for really pretty much anybody 
 um at least like i guess i had a type of idea about teaching but it was definitely not the same <$> then i tried to find alternative job, so now i'm like an admin assistant 
you know did a billion rocky, you can only have 999 million bells in the bank at once <$> but i think she reached that because the thing about turnips is it grows exponentially 
 that's why i have my daughter and start working <$> so i guess we didn't get any direction, what to talk about 
and the first people that they're going to try to do that too is the children <$> because when you think about it they're the first people that are it's not talked about that much but the kids are a big problem right 
 amazingly enough, we've been doing everything um through uh you know through delivery, i'm just doing a whole bunch of surveys <$> then i found prolific and then now where you're talking kind of cool, i'm not sure if you're kind of in the same boat like 
 and then my parents split up so we moved to carson city nevada for two years, then moved back to south dakota <$> then i went to colorado for a year for school and then here in wyoming 
so what what characters are those <$> because i see him but i don't really know a lot about them 
you know, like somebody who who spoke both growing up, if they can find somebody like that, then they're going to hire them for interpreting interpreting <$> so i don't really haven't done that 
 and then we also dissected a pig <$> so like women to like have a lab test after the dissection to know if we can like name body parts and all that 
 i mean a lot of people that saw so much money for going to college and i know that doesn't seem like a like it's worth it, right <$> because i mean, yeah, i mean how long would it take to pay off those loans and stuff like that 
i just love it right <$> because like a kindle book, even if i paid for it, it's like i own it 
 there probably was like a decrease of cases <$> but then people, i mean i'm sure people with like other health conditions like they had a rough time if you had asked 
 and like, because when they first came out, i'm just like, why do i need another device <$> because like you have your phone and then you have your computer, like why am i going to get, you know what i mean 
 and i think i think i think i did a pretty good job learning how to do it <$> then i found some editors to actually read the story and make sure all the typos and grammatical errors was cleared up 
 and it was the saints for my wife's having issues <$> because this was when we rescued the service dog 
 and he's like, what <$> because they never there like we have to go 
but then the next oldest after that is four years apart from us <$> so not anymore anyway 
 uh huh wow, interesting <$> so yeah, it's like you're you're being like the investigator investigator attorney 
 you need to get somebody shipped out to the west coast <$> then you have all these excuses come out and visit and oh, that's fun 
 and i had this uh well they were supposed to have off school longer, but with covid pushing school back and all that that cut some days off <$> so i was pointing a epic road trip with with the kids 
 because when it gets the rare times where it gets cold down here and cold for us is like in the 50s <$> so they yeah the iguanas will get so cold and they just they fall out of trees 
 yeah, mhm uh huh i'm thinking right, work tomorrow and then they'll get the stuff with my truck and at least do the baseboards and stealing tomorrow as well <$> then pressure wash and do the floor the following day off 
he's not stressed out constantly now <$> so a lot better 
hey that's the extent of it <$> so you're a gamer 
they this everybody, you know just oh, yep <$> then if and then if nobody is symptomatic, then you've got those people are walking around spreading it until something, you know 
no no and that's i mean that's what his dad dad does and that's always been the major influence on his life <$> so he's moving with him, he can tell me things about computers 
so that's why he has a service <$> because if he had his own rig, you'd have to have like a whole multiple setups just to just to support all the people coming in 
 that's the only thing i can wrap my head around <$> but then there are so many other websites also where it just website only 
so i'm kind of envious because i'm gonna get the opposite end of the spectrum <$> because i am terrified of flying 
 so i snip him off and filled out the form <$> then i just left my camera on 1037 
 and so i'm like in level 8000 something which you know most people are like in the 2000s or something <$> but um it was so crazy 
 he's like you're going to learn more about this country <$> then you learn in your lifetime by doing that one trail like, okay, cool, no problem 
and then the renaissance festival that i was gonna go to got cancelled <$> then the concert that i was gonna go to got canceled 
you said we're all very divided and then you lost it <$> so what you know 
just staying back and like idiots as long as i can't see it <$> but yeah, they were the wars and the yellers and her husband one time through a glow stick at the stage 
so i normally planned to drive to use the bus so that way like i can see stuff but there was always a little bit longer <$> but i i enjoy it and that happened to me a lot to that being here 
 but i miss the seeing other people <$> but i know that students, no offense, the students in our area come to school sick, they will come into the office in the fall sneezing and coughing 
 it's kind of it's difficult because you have one road map and then something just completely obliterate it and you have to try to rebuild from the start <$> so that's where i'm at 
 like you also have like kids too <$> so it's kind of like, oh now like no one has any time 
 because they have a higher percentage of people with money than like the other schools <$> because in addition to the super smart people who get scholarships, like it's the people who can actually afford to pay like $20,000 a semester plus room and board 
 and it's so fucking frustrated because when you're like you're like 15 minutes into this thing, you're like okay i'm on i'm almost done <$> then they get like the demographics, you fill it out and they're like okay you don't qualify 
 okay you don't want to wear the mess <$> but what about all of these people, especially the young children who don't even have that option 
so that was at least nice <$> but i don't know 
so and most of them are pretty big <$> so no, you have to cook it 
oh yeah, like within like a month <$> but yeah, yeah, it was really outrageous 
 how they do this now <$> because you okay, so we got livingsocial atlanta, which i use 
now where do they get <$> because like we always read us, we don't need cops enforced any kind of law that we would want to like, how are they going to force 
 we'll have like, you know some some dessert here and there <$> but the other day i so in florida we have i don't know what your local grocery stores ours is called 
 but next is latino in arizona we have many people not just for mexico many countries <$> so a lot of those people are in the in the thing to like, hey, you know what, what's going on 
 i've got two dogs, i've got an american eskimo dog, which is like a £20 fluffy white thing <$> then i have a pomeranian american eskimo mix, which is like a £15 fluffy red thing that looks like a fox hyperactive as hell 
 yeah man, we really want to get to the bottom <$> then they like went out and said so much 
 they consider that income <$> so my entire student loans with all that interest has been building, it's considered income that year 
but i'm like, boom <$> because yesterday it didn't look good 
those are smaller really tight knit asian communities <$> so there's like a suit asians in america on every single block 
so like, so do you have facebook <$> because it's a nightmare on facebook 
 i'm like, it pays less, no benefits <$> but i picked this job at the perfect time where all this covid shit target right before i started up 
 yeah that'll be me <$> then you go when you're just like blowing away 
um the first thing i left, i was like six <$> then the second time i left i was like nine 
 and then once the quotation threw up, right <$> because you can't do that 
um but he's got i want to say it's like a 40 many 40 minute trip on the ferry <$> then he's got to do i don't know the subway 
 we should be at home, you know, full time teleworking <$> but now they want to do that, they were simply considered essential 
like just catfish like yeah <$> but yeah, that's really cool 
they come up once in a while during the winter and they're like, we forgot how cold it is <$> but the fall though like right before like right now is the perfect time 
i were like five minutes me and this person cut and talked, shutting up shop thing where they could help me, but i couldn't tell them <$> then as soon as i was about to leave it fixed it 
was like shortcut mohammed and he zoomed his roads and he was like holy cow, this is crazy <$> so yeah he was he was great 
 i like the like the set days instead and then there's like a lot of like variations <$> but those are like the main too i guess 
yes, that's the same exact thing that i was waiting for <$> so i was like shoot because i was going to help me out a lot 
 they've got busy lives so they don't want to work so much <$> so it's is just such a tour trying to find therapists to actually do the job 
 i was like, wait, what <$> because i talked liking that someone was kicking in the doorway right there 
 so we're renting temporarily anyway <$> then the kids can still come and go as they want 
yeah you don't have to after like 34 times initial cash cash out <$> then you can do immediate 
 get out there these days <$> but but yeah, like uh like yeah, this is not the time for like individualism really 
 like my son he's he's in kindergarten and um he's very strong will <$> but part of part of us wonder if he has some kind of a 
 it just makes me worried, so to speak <$> so i don't really, it doesn't inform me and then it's going to change my behaviors, but it would definitely probably make me more worried or upset 
no ive there's no maybe once or twice while i've been in texas both times less than an inch or maybe an inch or two <$> but that's it for experience with any real amount to snow 
 like usually for me it was about a month after a month or two of really consistent sitting <$> then i finally saw it 
i'm really used to dealing with many different types of people with like all types of background <$> so i feel like that is what they might feel like the most qualified for other than like baby, like human resources and that kind of stuff 
 and so they ended up canceling the festival after like a couple of years <$> because many people would just hide he brought it back last year 
uh, so like manhattan's the middle kind of island <$> then there's bronx to the north in brooklyn to the south 
the government paid for it <$> then i went to wana hatta which is a city in mexico 
 oh they postponed it again, that we had another notification <$> then people are like, hell is going on 
 then we shut down and we didn't really need to because we didn't have any cases <$> then by the time june rolled around we opened back up 
 but then i was like, do you feel like i'm belittling you <$> because when we talk about guys, there's boys, guys and men, okay, they have like a neutral third term 
 well it's been 25 minutes <$> so we did it go up into the no, no 
 but yeah, it's never too like, i mean i didn't start until i was in high school, right <$> but you know, i keep learning it all the time then, you know, eventually get good at it 
 and at the time i think you still needed a college email address to sign up for it <$> because like at the yeah, so i signed up when it was like you needed the college email address and then you needed the 
 so i just would take off my shoes stand on a hard floor and it would hurt <$> but i would tell my brain, you know what, these are fake pain signals, there's no structural damage, the neurons are firing, they're just like confused 
 so um i started doing a lot of research about foods and information and things like that <$> so i decided to um like drop this elimination diet 
 so first i had to learn how to make, how to make foundations, box springs and all that <$> then i had to learn how to make mattresses because my job was to basically every every piece that came through 
it's a student paul <$> then i feel then i feel why they're sending so late 
 so i work from home so i don't have to deal with any anything at all <$> so yeah, i've been working from home for about five years now 
 so people started doing that, then they took that away <$> then they started limiting the time that he paid 
 i think they've covered a whole range of things, but i don't eat a lot of candy <$> but for some reason i think the candy ones were the ones that i found the most interesting because of the the machinery they've come up to do them 
yeah, so i was like, i really like the dressing up and everything like that, i thought that was pretty, that's pretty fun, right <$> because you don't get to wear that old kind of like dresses and stuff, and so i was like, we need like a permanent place for this 
so i'm glad i did then <$> but um so yeah, i had to do all that 
i do that too <$> then not much traveling 
 so like i think i do miss a lot of surveys when i'm sleeping, you know what i'm saying <$> because a lot of the colleges are probably going to release those surveys like six a 
so i'm glad that you showed up <$> so yeah, so what state are you and if you don't mind me asking florida, okay, i'm in ohio 
 that was a nice one <$> but then i got one that was a little bit, uh, she was a little bit odd 
uh and then after that they let me come home full time <$> so i've been at home for about a year and a half now 
uh so he knew i loved him <$> then i'm willing to my phone 
 i just wouldn't avoid the whole thing as much as possible <$> then i'd go give the speech and just spout off something rambled through 
 you know what i mean <$> because teachers have to be there 
so they couldn't erase it <$> because if that history was gone, that history, if we didn't say that it would have been gone 
yeah catholic, correct definitely <$> then if the person who is not going to take we'll always feel insecure with him or her, right 
but then it was a big stink that he left the pf <$> then he might have come back to the p 
so i think there's a lot of people that are being sent here from other places because of how how good the houston medical community community is here <$> then boston has the same thing at least from what i understand 
 i'll just look at it <$> but i haven't i don't know anything about it what it's about or so 
so i guess we hit our time <$> then you too nice feeding you 
 they had the two days a week, they had the farmers market downtown <$> then in the early fall they had what was called the mountain glory festival and that was just amazing 
okay, you ever feel like cheating work <$> because because you know, you know the follow up questions or like is this person kind is this person smart 
 but it's just like go like, like every day for like this week, then stopped for two weeks <$> then when i go back, i leave to live today, i come back home 
 like i'm obsessed with music <$> but like if i were to choose a favorite band, probably be my chemical romance 
 so i had to take a shift in that because that can kind of, you know, hinder you emotionally sometimes and bring stress <$> so you have to really do what you're what you're passionate about 
 and then it gets in my head, right <$> because if i don't let you down, i don't want to you know i mean i'd like to have an orgasm myself too 
so that's kind of weird for him <$> but otherwise i feel like he's taking it pretty much destroyed 
 we have to go hit unclaimed baggage <$> because like you thought that interesting, like it wasn't quite what i expected 
oh wow, me neither <$> but that's like very very very rare to find 
and then you get like the really awful ones at first <$> then it gets better 
i was playing games <$> then i shot him on yesterday and i was like, and so i was like um i'm doing a lot better at that point 
 that's what absolutely none other than walter is my health <$> because when you die, that's where you're going 
 and um and the mail <$> then sometimes that's why i engage my seventh prolific, which i will pay 
 but sometimes you don't qualify, you get kicked out before surveys done or whatever <$> but you get the money in your piggy bank right away and you could cash out to paypal whenever you want 
 art in my language <$> but i think, you know, especially looking at our country compared to the rest of the world, whether it be europe or i don't know, japan or anywhere else 
so she had me super young <$> then two years later came to the u 
 i think it really helps if you like actually live there <$> then your prices are like reduced by a lot 
 or something like that <$> but i was very rare 
yeah, it's like, well, i told him i was like, if i am not gonna, if i'm not here, it's because i've gotten really sick <$> but when i tested positive, i didn't have symptoms, but then like a couple days later, i got a really high fever, just like i was on the couch 
like at like now looking back on it, it was a good experience because i got a lot better towards the end <$> but when i first moved there, i was like an airbnb, couldn't find like a permanent place to live, didn't have any friends 
so like my teammates, like, hey lse get back, get your ass back here, we're about to die <$> then i come back 
let's get so like i'm never gonna fall off or something <$> then also you have, when they have like randomized posts that are funny and shit 
 i just ate a cookie <$> so like i'm thinking about food 
 i think it might be me <$> so i was using i was using bluetooth on a different device, listen to music because i was waiting for a couple by microphones working obviously 
 but uh you know, we did have a lot in common <$> so he thought maybe they had like matched us up with some kind of, you know, that we would have something in common 
it is what it is <$> but like yeah you're are your parents like pretty bored right now or is there like kind of like like the same 
anyways, so how's all the corona stuff going over there with you <$> because is it bad where you are, anything works out 
 sorry by any chance do you know david figueroa <$> because i have a buddy who is also in a study abroad program 
uh well i prayer you know why don't we just need change <$> because i think the united states of america as a whole is kind of disorganized right now 
 oh that's good, that's good <$> so what are you finding to do 
 i'm like exactly, how different are you gonna use uh your ps five vs ps four <$> because i haven't really looked into, that's what we would get would be the ps five 
 but you don't, i mean you don't think of it that way, right <$> because it's like, oh, just in case i die or just in case someone wants to kill me or something happens 
 are they watching everyone or and if you're using a certain band with, you know, what are they looking for <$> because i've just never uh huh 
 and guess what's going to happen here <$> because the team is already going down to where the rain is going to have to call and shannon said, you're kidding me to the shepherds get on down 
 and i'm like what <$> because i went to a small college in the center of the state 
 the guy last he was just like, wow <$> because like all this crazy, you know like other running gas and this guy is pouring like gas in my car with a coke bottle 
 i think i've definitely grown to dislike it more than i used to <$> so that my i know i have an automatic negative connection with it now, that's for sure 
 what did they uncover of what <$> because there's like 1000 things you can pick from 
yeah so i'm i'm managing the project just came here for handling a project in the new york area <$> so i was there for two years that project got finished and company said okay don't go to india and there's something different new project for you in florida 
 how often do you get service <$> because i feel like minor like really sporadic like they don't really like they're not consistent 
oh, have you been doing a time <$> because i haven't been doing a timer 
oh so it happened for me two times like that <$> then after that every time everybody showed up on time 
 so um it's pretty neat and all days <$> so nice because it's such a small store 
so everyone here is like very educated mostly doing what they're supposed to do <$> so the numbers have been pretty down where we're at 
yeah, so we're probably as the crow flies about 150,25 mi from there <$> but of course there is no direct route from here 
like how many rotations the motor is taken because their hub driven their hub motors <$> so like the front wheel uh wants to tread and stuff starts to go bad on it 
 this is the first time i've done something like this <$> so i i was just hoping mhm 
 he really doesn't care <$> but you know why i bought that eye cream 
 i don't want to unplug my computer <$> but yeah, so usually when i'm using my computer, i'm actually looking at this giant monitor, not my little bitty laptop screen 
so do you know what are we supposed to do now <$> because i know it's not like to keep like the conversation 25 minutes and then extra i don't 
 nobody else seemed to recognize them <$> but i happened to look over there and i'm like, that's jerry rice 
yeah multi use classroom work room, everything in one room <$> because apartments are not cheap 
we have two little kids, so she gets up a lot of time in the middle of the night with that <$> but it's been a long week actually almost forgot about this and that 
look it up i guess <$> but let's see what he told me 
i'm like, yeah, ok <$> then i'm like sitting here going, nobody's here 
 they had fixed it and it had drained out and i was like, i think it's time for us to get rid of it <$> then we went up, i don't know, in late june to clean and look at the state of things and everything was fine 
 both those guys are huge <$> but yeah that was i got tired of it 
 no it's a seller, it's a seller's market, it's a seller's market <$> but no it could be it depends it could be different 
well, there's certain applications where it be cool, but i don't think gaming is there another thing gaming will be until probably another 10, 20 years <$> because even if you have that on your head there's not much more to in mercy right now and i don't just for gaming i don't think it's great 
like i can just do it here <$> but you know, i think it's just when you're in your own space, you just have so many other patterns and distractions pulling you in 
 well i mean some of them are, some of them are i mean i'm taking classes that are recorded just so happened that way <$> but they have a sink 
 and then came back up here <$> so for the most part, i mean i'm used to the big city, so this is really small 
so that was kind of a bummer because i didn't get paid for that <$> but yeah, but otherwise it's been pretty good 
 we want to go away so bad <$> but yeah, you know it is what it is 
on your location right now <$> because you said you're on break 
 i was, as i celebrated my birthday and death for alex, i thought that would be the funniest and so went there <$> then i came back here and i was supposed to house sit for my dad for a month while uh like for this like interim period 
 antibiotics, put me on oral, sent me home <$> then a few days later i ended up back with the same problem still going on because they didn't want me in the hospital 
so i could be virtually invisible <$> so that might be just as just as the zoom meetings are my teleportation superpower, you can make zoom your invisibility somehow 
uh was it nor color <$> so cal i've been something over two 
 you're like, you know what it doesn't sound like <$> so i think i want this 
 he's like, hey look, this is what i'm doing <$> but most of the folks that work there all claim that uh that they were going to get into the industry and everything was gonna work out for him 
 so that's good now, i'm actually doing all this stuff <$> so i feel like yes 
yeah, yeah, this is my 3rd 1 <$> so you, i mean you don't okay, so we're about the same one 
 but it's never, it's always been the kind of thing where i can force myself into a social situation <$> then afterwards i get really anxious about it 
i've trained my cat to jump up and sit right in front of me on my keyboard <$> because whenever she does that, i just start petting her absent mindedly snap 
 if there's any place that you get like um unsolicited emails about surveys and things because you probably will because they're going to say your name everywhere <$> then always look it up there that way you don't know what voice and your time and it's legitimate or not 
 i just just need to focus on my education and get the money <$> then the wife would come after that 
like there's just so much like sensationalism like you just can't trust like one singular source <$> so i'm just kind of, i don't know, i'm just kind of like chilling at home 
 the heat would help it <$> but here we are going into fall it's going to cool down and then what and then i really don't know what four weeks are supposed to do 
and she was also going to work at uh she went to a sleep away camp for several years which was like a farm camp she really like <$> so she was going to be counselor this year and also worked part time 
yeah, this they settle their at their age of nearly 24 or five <$> then uh they made a job job here and they bought themselves their house 
what did she just admit that covid is real <$> then they say so the syphilis, but don't see a bragging about that 
 and then i got laid off along with about a third of the company <$> then i was at church telling someone that, hey, i got laid off from my job and this is what i do 
 so like in terms of how close down it is over there, um like how does it look like <$> because he said you've just kind of been inside and stuff, right 
that's where i always wanted to go when, when i like retire and just go somewhere <$> because i love wisconsin country 
 i mean i think just being on the prolific platform right <$> because i mean clearly that's i i realized i mean i'm not a psychologist 
yeah i guess it's pretty what you're four hours earlier than us, right <$> because it's quarter it's almost 10:00 at night here 
 you just closed the tub and go back to the previous page the other time on it <$> then you continue this, then you continue this so that you fill out your yes, that's it 
 like the bird is like almost coming up <$> then you cook that 
 i'll see to it <$> so what what it yeah sure 
 they weren't allowed to do anything <$> but man, if you aren't even allowed to add anything that's not in the textbook, how are you expected to learn 
 i think it was like if it's yellow, if it's black with yellow stripes and that's poisonous <$> but if it's got the yellow and the stripers black, i'm like, if i'm that close, i'm too close 
do you have like a recommendation for another one <$> because i don't really know any others that are looks good 
this is a good one <$> because anyway i have to be on the computer 
 and it's uh several her brother, several nieces, cousins and stuff are actually in the show <$> then there's video of her, you know, where they kind of interact cut in 
 ship at the ucs to pay your way <$> but once you've passed your they call them comprehensive exams it means you're not dumb or not as dumb as you were previously 
 the only people on campus um are people with um, home insecurity issues <$> so the original plan was to have people with like those sorts of issues 
yeah, i'll be soon <$> so how many minutes have we'll be chatting for 
uh he's very unemployed because he's a professional view list <$> so he's like how to get out of my viola 
 so i grew up in california style was 15 <$> then i moved to texas and there's like a little part in the valley, like mayor lancaster, palmdale area 
and then after that it paid me like over £100 over like £120 generally <$> because after that they 
 i'll voice my opinion on something and i'm gonna stick to my, to my values and, and things like that <$> but at the same time i'll put things out, but i'm not going to start, i'm not petty 
so it's like, so how does that work <$> because i'm like, if you have, if it's just being tested now, like, you know, that's that's a struggle point because i'm like, do i 
 i wasn't paying attention much to it when he gave it <$> but yeah, i thought it was interesting 
i mean because you don't really want to adopt a kid, like you want a part time kid <$> then why wouldn't you be a big brother or big sister or something 
 and then they also taught automotive automotive services, it's like how to fix your car, how to get into the automotive trade and then not separate from welding <$> then there was also a viticulture club in class 
 so there's a way that i can make that work and make it more than just like, you know, self serving, doing whatever i want to do <$> so yeah, but i'm also really young, so who knows, anything can happen 
i don't know and then there's been some other game companies trying to make something similar now too <$> then the new assassin's creed i believe just released valhalla okay and the new destiny two expansion hit and the water warcraft expansion is heading next week 
 i'm wondering, have i been there that long <$> because i'm crazy because i'm so used to just being idle 
so i feel like i'm pretty i should be safe <$> but uh i live with my husband 
 well, i talk about polling and stuff like that, but i don't talk about like, you know, detailed stuff really <$> because it just, it does, it ends up with us yelling and we have the same things over and over again and much more to the point of that 
 you know, like we got, we got our, our kids go visit their mom every other week <$> so we're like, oh yeah, we got no kids this weekend, we'll go somewhere and hang out 
um well i actually just managed to get a job as a tax preparer <$> so i'll be working as a tax preparer for a couple of years 
like do you see me <$> because i i do not mm weird your venue was completely gone, well it's not your fault 
oh no that's bad <$> then you need to stay in the south 
 if you're not going to go to rio or sao paulo, you're probably going to go to uh well if you're single, you're gonna go to gagne <$> because that's where like, you know, there's it's a very liberal area to meet men and women 
 and you know that stupid questions and you know, the person might be waiting for you <$> then i saw you pop up and i was like, i'm late 
which isn't like, i mean it's it's good to know i guess, but i just need to stop spending so i can get that happy bag <$> but with incacart i made $98 so i would basically made it back 
i didn't, i wasn't particularly outside before that, but i mean we went out, you know <$> but mostly my boyfriend went out, we would just go drive around or we would go out to eat or something 
because like right now they've been begging for people to record like audio commands <$> because they worked with ai developing artificial intelligence and they're paying like, you know, 25, cents for each command 
your stomach is always, yeah <$> so like 23 years of not burping 
or like we finally realized like, oh yeah, and went and got a pen and paper <$> so i actually had a pen and paper handy this time thinking it was going to happen again, right 
look, i get tired of mine <$> then i would wait till like, okay, i'm good now 
but i'm trying to get back into it again <$> so i mean i might take you up back up on that so we'll see 
i'm kind of i'm here temporarily at least pandemics over mostly <$> but yeah, that's funny 
 yeah they don't want they don't want people to have cars at all <$> so they make it only the super rich 
 and then of course, the second question is, do you know the osmonds <$> because obviously, because obviously that clearly from utah, you must be a mormon and you must know the osmonds, right 
 i said, oh, is it like, is the conditions like a bit better in maryland <$> because i go to school in new york and it's been like, everything should shut down 
 it's it's kind of more of a visual novel type thing <$> but yeah, the other game is called 999 
 honestly, what are some of the other sites you've tried <$> because i've got a lot of this stuff like i'm pretty familiar with this kind of work, the page document to get to know for sure 
well, that's like saying, yeah, but not that many people died because of this <$> because well, you know, back then when we when you said, you know, there was all these these plagues 
 she, i got to hold a baby lion once and their paws are so big <$> but when we got him, his paws were about the same size and i was like, oh no, you know, like instantly like, oh no, a baby lion here 
 very cool, very cool <$> so what's your what's your workload like this semester 
i just had one more to get that over with <$> but yeah that was really hard to pass and i'm being honest 
and i mean there you can literally hop on a train and be anywhere in 45 minutes <$> so it's a little different here where i get in the car and i drive 45 minutes and i'm like in indiana or somewhere dumb like you know 
 i hate that we're in this predicament <$> but yet here we are 
 i feel like after i do that in the morning <$> so uh it's kind of multifaceted i guess 
 do it so you don't forget it <$> but it's it's it works 
 it's really zero, but it's few enough that it's meaningless <$> but you know, the problem is, is somebody gonna come in who is traveling in florida, you know, or something like it 
 it's like, let's say i don't get my land like a 10 year as a professor <$> then i have a master phd in computer science 
 and what got me were the ice storm <$> so i'm not used to that, i'm used to snow 
yeah, they're like, well this is what we talked about <$> so birds, isis fighters 
and i don't know what happens <$> then it becomes like some giant, well, you know like when we had sandy here, which wasn't even a hurricane, it was superstorm 
 but i told her i was like it's way easier because when i'm in the store i'm so focused on trying not to like be around too many people <$> then you forget stuff and you're like rushing but there you can make a list and just go, you know do all the shopping 
 but i'm like where did they get this money from <$> because i would ask for the money to buy a tiger 
 like sitcoms, family sitcoms <$> because the only other reality tv show i watch is like catfish 
 is um they're they're doing it in a bubble <$> so they essentially to close off, i think half of uh walt disney world resorts and they're all in there, no one's allowed in there, not allowed out 
 minimum wage is now $15 which is great compared to the rest of the country <$> because i know in virginia i think it's still like seven bucks, right 
so you're, you can see everything going on <$> but it's your germs, you're staying in your rocks on, right 
 i was really surprised when beginning this at the beginning of that <$> because you would say it's just like a survey, right 
yes, you're kind of isolated <$> so i was like, yeah, i guess it's cool and all and you tell people and they're like, oh yeah, that's fancy 
 and then like around, i saw back of his head and walking out and was like, i think that is him <$> so he has like the spiky hair thing going on 
oh, wow, that's cool <$> so i guess uh is there any like a job opportunity in philadelphia 
you'd be surprised because some of the, some of the newer ones do are are that simple to play <$> because i played some ones that were um what we call the, i think uh, xbox 3 60 or something like that and the same thing 
 that's all stuff that shut down, right <$> so movie theaters, so movies shut down parks very minimal attendance uh like espn and like sports and that sort of stuff 
so then it's like, let me hurry up while you have lunch, try to do some work and then switch you back over <$> so that was miserable 
 i had somebody tell me i should apply for habitat for humanity house actually <$> so uh huh that's absolutely sure you can't be overly cautious, i don't think with the pandemic 
it's a user testing site <$> but um, they'll pay you like $25 or $5 for a quick thing 
 i would rather have had the star still glowing <$> then these painted over one 
 and i mean you did psych right <$> because that's a pretty, i think that's a pretty in demand thing 
this is your opportunity to give them an extra boost where others don't you know what i mean <$> because when when kids are young people are like so encouraging, ridiculously encouraged 
and we played poker because in high school and a little bit in college we played poker like every weekend <$> so just texas hold'em 
 i mean who's very valuable time on that <$> so i'm i don't know, it's it's at some point somebody's gotta step and say, you know what i think you've lost thanks 
and it's like why even tell me what am i going to do about it <$> because i live in a trailer 
 do you have any pictures or anything <$> because i've never seen like any time 
 i had a whole separate account for that and i give my checking account with my husband's and pay the bills and do whatever with that <$> then we always have all my money for because i get my son he's ever backing, which just about if possible 
 so it's like two completely different colors now <$> so it's like yeah 
so the beginning of the movies, their regular life <$> then you don't see all his cancer 
 i got 20 years service and retired back in 2000 when my daughters were little and my mom was sick and i took four years off <$> then i went back four years later, worked for 15 more years and got my 35 years 
 because like i said, when you think of just history, how many cases probably could have unfolded with those additional things, you know what i mean <$> but like you said society wise we're not really prone to wanting to tell everybody everything or having extra security cameras around 
 i'm like, are you really not though <$> because we're all egocentric, like we're all literally the centers of our own worlds and when we engage in relationships platonic romantic or sexual, you're gaining something from it 
 but fortunately her school's back in session five days right now <$> so although kids have the option of being online in her class 
we've just been covered in smoke off and on <$> but today it's beautiful 
 they used to have shelters <$> so it's been a bit of a learning experience for them 
 you know the topography that all those options would be there <$> but you just think of it 
what are you are we all doing it through the same site <$> because i i'm using prolific, prolific 
 like we don't want to go ahead and having like 100% for the council's <$> then you push it out of pc and pc turns out to be garbage 
what do we, what do we do <$> because i feel like we've got a couple of minutes left 
so i was like oh man <$> but is it so you've done this one before 
well, gray, that's why i asked you how is gray spelled <$> because you said the gray zone 
 you have more flexibility to like teach and get into research later on <$> then you do with the masters, which one kind of interested in 
 but um, because i'm 30 for about 35 <$> but so this is like 10 years ago 
 so that's what i write in during lab <$> so as long as you get to the end result of the lab it's fine 
 oh sure they weren't there unfortunately <$> but yeah, i bet there is a documentary about the guy that played big bird 
 and then the governor was like, you know going back to school after spring break <$> so um i didn't have the chance to go to the actual school and teach and i couldn't go to trainings or by cultivating nothing 
and people, somebody will take that and make a more full left song with it, but they're a little bit is pivotal to the way the song sounds <$> but since they started a stock, they may not have any claim on the any money that was earned by the full song 
they didn't, you know at the high school they kept her pretty good <$> so it'll be interesting you know, i think they'll have a little more time to prepare 
 alright, so first thing we had was an atari <$> then we got an intend to and then when sega genesis came out, i said, oh my gosh, i don't know how anything can get better than this 
because that would just be garbage <$> then you could just come along with a trash bag and be like, okay 
uh i'm like, let's name at 11 <$> so we had the five and now we have 11 but uh it's 11 miles over there 
 so i didn't get graham like, oh well whatever, that's not going to go anywhere <$> then she sends me email, can you interview with me on monday 
yeah, so i just cleaned up their mess basically <$> but the cookies were good 
what did you do with your family when he was japan <$> because i know that's also a big tourist destination 
it feels the us kind of feels like 50 different countries that you know at some point <$> because i mean it really is like canada just seems a bit more, you know, united are on the same page 
 i work in online advertising <$> so everything that we can do, yeah, uh, on social media google all of that stuff, email marketing, things like that 
 we have very similar views <$> then i grew up with you found evangelical church 
 they don't want to grocery eight basically <$> because the job yeah 
 how do you get a little dry then you salt it really good and you rub the salt and that's burning it <$> then you wrap it really tight in the plastic wrap it really tight 
i need to count in my head <$> so yeah, i know that's the thing 
 um but here they're little, i don't know <$> then they could do better, but it's hard because there's such a small state, there's not a lot of enforcement 
as is demonstrated by the fact that i am telling a random stranger after 2013 minutes <$> because it brings me so much joy 
 now i'll be two or three minutes <$> then you have another lip till the electrical conductivity stops, but you don't have a steady heart rate of 35 
 so i was like, what's going on there <$> because middle school kids don't bring home their computers and they're like, no, no, i'm rescuing your computer home 
do they get in trouble <$> so if you decide just to not go so like true and say they go after you 
it's been called curious cat <$> then i use sometimes it's okay 
 um, they did say they are probably going to bring some people back part time before they bring them back full time <$> because i'm in the department that actually books the shows were the first department that really needs to get back up and running 
well, they want to come back though, can you come back or will they let you go at all <$> because yeah, that's a big mm next know that yeah 
 yeah, i used to uh i used to work for blockbuster and um we were open every day of the year except for thanksgiving <$> but no, actually we're open on thanksgiving 
i think except for like people would take like labs and everything like that <$> then you have to go to class to do your lab 
 or or you can take the ferry over from seattle to downtown bremerton <$> then on the return trip, the ferry tapes right into downtown seattle 
but then i had to bed next to the window to the only window and then she'll she did on my bed and then threw them out the window <$> then the police came 
 and i know there's like strikes usually lockheed martin the strikes <$> so and i feel the third strike doesn't matter 
yeah and it shouldn't be something we should be fighting about like you said <$> but i mean i get why people are frustrated 
 she was like no <$> so i think this time around the that thing that the pandemic, they played it down, they jeopardize the whole lot of families 
 my mom's like, why do you keep buying toothpaste bought 17 tubes last week <$> because if you see at the point i get in return and she just looks like she's like, oh yeah, you're right 
so i definitely miss like just going outside like and hiking and stuff <$> but well, i mean i like the midwest 
 well how did it affect your town talking about doing another one <$> but that here how did it affect your town with stock 
and that's why it took me so long to get my degree <$> because if you look at my academic transcript it's like withdrawal withdrawal, withdrawal withdrawal withdrawal withdrawal withdrawal withdrawal withdrawal, withdraw a withdrawal withdrawal, withdraw the withdraw withdraw, withdraw 
 some cats have six toes, and i'd never heard of that <$> then she said, you need to research the hemingway cats 
 yeah, no, 10 years i worked for like a big mutual fund company right out of school <$> then i went to like a small like investment bank where i was like issuing debt, and then i went to grad school from there 
i you know, i wish i could check in but there's no way <$> then my second time was guy in very rural florida who worked at a grocery store and he was interesting too 
 like my ex husband is from virginia <$> so i know okay i got where virginia is where in d 
 um, you're my fifth, but the one before the last, i thought i was like, okay, great <$> because i had a bunch of back to back 
 like i i don't believe to the level that my wife believes um like even when she tries to help me experiences and stuff i'm like now whatever <$> but like i do yeah i do deep down i yeah i think i do the seven and eight 
i'm not i mean i'm sort of worried for them, right <$> because it's like i don't i don't want you to die, like just because you're stupid 
 what are the odds <$> so there are actually more people here documenting and showing how empty the city is than actually people in the streets 
and if we think we're, if we think we're close, we can talk a few more minutes just to be sure or whatever you want to do <$> but yeah, yeah, because then we got to sit and answer all those questions afterwards 
yeah i think this is going to make it hard on kids social skills right <$> because they really need that peer interaction to be able to blossom in the social domain so 
when i originally got here with the job, i had regular desks <$> then i got the job, the position and fortunately a colleague of mine, just a couple doors down had tables 
 i'm hoping, you know, i mean, i think the way, well, you know, you think about cold and flu season, right <$> because i think it's cold virus 
so started with think we, let's see we flew into osaka which is the second largest city, went to osaka <$> then we went to believe hiroshima 
 i went because the thing is where i come from we were i was very into protest because of the government in general <$> so i have taste 
you know, sometimes people say, well, it's red, blue, whatever, it's really purple <$> so um everyone's going to say, well it's shifting more, shifting more liberal and it's like just sort of moves around 
they're like you know it's $60 <$> then a root canal ends up being like $3 
not that i don't believe in god in the bible and all that kind of stuff <$> but you know, you know, you have to look at some of it and say, you know over the past, say the past 20 years 
um, and my sister moved on tennessee to go to school <$> then she met a guy and i had a baby, so she's there now for her 
so that was really fun <$> then that got cut short because school is closing 
 and finally my son my son is an adult and we live in the apartment here together <$> but he just said mom i have to give the cat back, he won't stop biting 
 so i went there for middle school and i'm like i don't like that much <$> then i came back to new york 
uh we'll see about that <$> so anyway, you hit the nail on the head with more than 25 minutes 
 but it's like maybe maybe a really strong man <$> so that was uh that was really great 
 how is it there <$> because it looks like you're in the downtown or do people go out at night and pardon me play without nasa 
 if they get scared they will claw you <$> but other than that they're really friendly 
 but i'm just like, is this happening to other people <$> because it's just nightmare night 
so for like three months they paid me $100 for three months just to be in a focus group <$> then something else that i've done with my pole at town surveys that only paid me like maybe 50 cents 
but no, it's it's, you know, i'm not digging a ditch <$> so it's pretty it's pretty good 
especially if you like have a minimum wage job or something or like pc tech <$> then i get paid that well 
my family's all in washington state <$> then i just i canceled some business trips 
and it's like i said, it was just one of those things that i think it opened up the change of abnormal situations being the salvation for her <$> because like i said, when you think of just history, how many cases probably could have unfolded with those additional things, you know what i mean 
 you're gonna get dallas is like 500 miles north from where i live <$> so like i'm on, i'm on the gulf coast and yeah, yeah 
some people have the cars that will, you know, kind of do it all on their own <$> but yeah, i hate that too 
i don't know if you've heard of it but it's each survey like 10 to 15 minutes, they pay 2 to $3 <$> but the like the kind of the interesting part is every three surveys you do you get a $2 bonus and it seems legit 
 like in japan, like when i was living there, you would see people like we have cold and whatnot <$> because the country, right 
 they have to compile all of the different studies that have ever been done and then the fda looks through everything and then they have questions <$> then you might have to design a new study in order to answer their questions back and forth and back and forth and then they give their recommendation 
 i had a, there are a couple of weeks at work during the summer where i was happy that i was given permission and primarily tele work <$> because um the thing i think the one thing that i appreciate about working with the military is that like it is a relatively diverse workforce 
 like how do you keep <$> because it makes sense because i have mostly i have a lovely high school and that makes sense 
 rather than trying to find a spreadsheet somewhere that may or may not be the original <$> so different departments are tracking the same number than that same number three in the same place, not in each department's uh database or separate structure on the spreadsheet 
 so we're kind of stuck <$> but yeah, we usually go to charleston once or twice a year or so 
 i'm online working these sites, learning internet marketing <$> but i, but i did this years ago 
 because you said you're afraid to go out a lot like neighborhoods <$> because we have a lot of people who go outdoors just like walking, do things 
 like that would slide <$> but if you try that with somebody from illinois, then like they'll be able to see right through it 
 oh yeah i was gonna say it, that's so interesting <$> so how has the town like that been affected by all the coronavirus stuff 
so they're trying to go around and hang a bunch of people within this group in order to find these people <$> but there's so many good liars on there 
 so uh he don't use to put much effort in anything earlier <$> but when is he a good result then he used to get into it 
 it's hard now because they're saying obviously the cases are rising again because everybody is back in school they're going to find them shutting everything down again <$> then what do people do 
this will be my last question for you <$> because i know we're at time 
like that's pretty much what i'm really thinking <$> but yeah, i don't know, the first thing i'm looking forward to doing once this is all done is traveling because i miss doing that 
 maybe not this year, not this year <$> then next year, it's nice chatting with you, too 
it's like 17 cents a minute <$> so it's like $10, an hour 
yeah, it's really bad <$> but uh that's what happens when people don't listen or don't want to 
 i don't even know like i did the microphone check and i said it was working well <$> then you're telling me like you're gonna hear me 
i hope they come for other things too besides just their game <$> but some of them only come for that so i can't fault them for that if that's what they're wanting but yeah so what do you do then 
 but then like, but i was able to tolerate it <$> but then star wars, i was like, no, i'm done 
 i'll start teaching when the schools start up <$> then they went to hybrid 
 love dogs but cannot would not be, i can't keep plants alive <$> so they but they're too like the family i take care of 
 i just moved here <$> so i'm a yeah, yeah 
 and so it's kind of interesting, right <$> because like it's covid season and obviously like our companies like super busy 
 um i don't know the problem with florida is that there's just no like uniformity because like the governor doesn't know what he's doing <$> so like different cities are like, okay, you have to wear a mask, but like the governor hasn't done anything 
 uh he just shut down the bars for a period of time during the summer <$> but then now he's saying i will never do that again 
 and something that i talked to my boss about is that this virus mutates <$> so what's going around right now is going to be mild compared to like the second generation 
maybe use something i know to figure out how to how to deal with this cauldron <$> but you're like real life just requires experience 
and so i'm like, well what do i have an arm's reach <$> because i'm a collector myself 
 i said who's in the bushes <$> then them fags are down there fucking in the bushes 
and then i'll see one <$> but i hate when like it's for the computer 
 oh, i wish i'll show out because you know, everybody kind of shut down in april and mulch <$> then one, by the time june everybody got tired of shutting down and a lot of things kind of opened back up 
 yeah like arizona like we get hit hard with the crazy son that it's too much sometimes at least for like a lot of hours, right <$> because got to drink lots of water and stuff and hydrate good 
 you know, just allowing everybody cases kind of like started going up a little bit <$> then the old illinois, the case is also like going up and everything like that 
the first night i had to take all these reaction tests <$> then they kept me up for 38 hours straight and having to take the reaction tests and just get slower and slower 
it's like two hours ahead and then my phone and laptop don't agree <$> so uh i live in naperville 
 um i study, so technically i study physical chemistry but essentially i study atmospheric chemical reaction <$> so i recreate important reactions that happen in the atmosphere in a vacuum chamber in my lab 
so i was born in providence and then we lived in central florida pre and then disney era <$> then i moved up here in new york 
 so you have to find some guy like a priest, him to teach you how to read <$> then you can read um like riding a horse, you have to have somebody to teach at sword fighting, you have to learn all those things 
 did yeah it was just insane here <$> then i'm in new york city, i'm in manhattan 
 yeah, i've been healthy <$> so yeah, he seems to be getting better 
well then it just makes me feel old <$> so then i'm like, okay now like you're sucking the youth from me, like go away 
 i even asked the lady, i said, so did you hit my eyeball or not <$> because she was like, what 
uh huh you mentioned a lot of socializing and like perseverance that's needed <$> then you don't get to be like in a place physically 
 i am, i'm pursuing graduate school here <$> so um that's why i'm still here, but i'm really ready to be done with 
 i turned 18 so earlier than that <$> but it's not like it's very easy to make $2 an hour there 
 every single time practically we have somebody like leave the game or something <$> then we have to like completely restart 
like how much do you have a timer that works <$> because i don't think i don't think so 
oh i uh which one you you mentioned <$> because this is the only one i know 
 i really didn't have to do much <$> but i did i did get a list here of some questions 
 so um do you travel a lot <$> because you said i know you sail

whatever people are weird <$> so what are you studying 
 it was like, not again and i have a lot of friends up in massachusetts <$> so it was always, you know, they always give me grief for it 
it's like remember that like it was yesterday <$> but yes, i mean for you, i guess that would mean you that was 19 years ago 
 what was the point of that whole thing anyway <$> because you didn't hear anything that they were talking about 
 no professor, no teacher <$> but she took it to the point where literally i remember things about people look at me like i'm not like, okay, what are you 
but but at the same time, like are we reaching too far <$> because you have i mean, for a while, they were we still have issues with certain technology giving off radiation and harmful things to the body if this continues 
but at the time i lived in this about five years ago i lived in colorado <$> so i just sort of travel from minneapolis to denver i would drive through parts of iowa to go visit him and so on

 most of the songs are kind of blend i guess <$> but it was really good
