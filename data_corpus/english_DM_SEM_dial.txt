i think you think it's a sandwich<$>so of course a hot dog is a sandwich just because it's a yeah, well, i'm very liberal when it comes to this
uh huh yeah, we'll call i what is it doing<$>but right now i just put a bunch of ads up on facebook, like i posted them in like different local groups to write towns around where i live
i guess it's like yeah but it hasn't hasn't yet<$>but no it hasn't
i'm definitely gonna go check that out<$>because prolific a lot of times you know you're sitting there and there's nothing open
okay i am american<$>so i, i guess you are american
don't worry about it<$>so um do you play video games
um quite the guard dog<$>because there stop it girl
mhm yeah, that's me<$>because like some people a little bit more
that might be how they have the crowds then<$>because what you do is they still get paid because there's the ticket feet and then there's the processing fee
okay, uh huh where do you go for your your news about your uh stocks or<$>so that is one thing is go uh yeah
kind of glad i graduated<$>so what are the uh huh i've definitely been hearing mixed feelings about that
mhm yeah, good, i'm glad you did<$>but yeah, i've been doing cooking, i did the bread thing like everyone else i am, then i moved on to pizza, so now i'm doing pizza making
yeah there's dirt and trees and grass and animals and then there's if you take obsidian and build it into a portal<$>so uh huh it takes you to like hell basically
i won't say anything<$>but yeah, i like this
that'll do it ice<$>so how long do you normally do the conversation for like half an hour or something like that
and then it's i don't either, i'm from uh not only skill<$>but like it's a good skill
oh and you, was it just a fine alcohol like<$>so and and then i had and if you couldn't answer the question, you have to stand outside, you have to stand outside until you got to question
mhm dang that's messed up, they should be reimbursing you for that day<$>but i just think it's dumb
more yeah, basically i was raised here um yeah, i was born in washington state but i barely spent any time there as a kid<$>so are you from colorado, basically
you're getting your money already<$>because i mean because since the pandemic started, we've been staying for home
like i i wasn't expecting us to come through and not even that fast like i guess here we go<$>so how long ago was that
what equals that's horrifying<$>but it is some kind of like uneven number
oh yeah yeah yeah<$>but you know, sometimes they need to realize like, you know, like one is eight years old
mm well right okay<$>but fall is my favorite season
yeah, so you're uh so i think i don't i haven't veered too far away from my house in the last five months<$>but other than that, i mean, you can't basically do much, right
if it happens it happens if not you know no big<$>so you just give you, just get free merchandise pretty much
oh okay okay so you'll be going back then<$>so they pay us uh i mean they pay her uh an s dependent uh to to live in here and they pay the university for her
so now i've been here about seven years from the east coast, originally from new york actually<$>so are you um have you always lived in seattle
it does, it makes it a lot<$>so yeah, it's probably like mid 90s
yes, everything's going to be, yeah<$>but yeah, like i i feel like i'm a warm warm body because like i immediately start sweating after a shower and i feel like it's always yeah, yep
it i've been to pittsburgh, i haven't been to kenny berg, kenny, kenny one<$>because we have kennywood park
yeah we're over time<$>so we are safely over 25 minutes
oh yeah, but so i think it's been below freezing here<$>but that's not like we don't get that a lot so
yeah, this is just yeah<$>so like i go on an annual camping trip every year
so yeah, it's like kinda it's not like uh i mean you could possibly do volunteer but there's a there's a lot<$>because see for um, buses like that
yeah and no i'll be here now<$>so you just think for the phd and then after you graduate
so oh i'm alexis, what's your name<$>but what's your name
and most of your sorry<$>because the taxes hired
yeah, i don't know<$>because these are going out
what about you and you guys have better weather i think<$>but this week it's just been raining nonstop
how did you get, how did you get started on it<$>but i had it kept every now and then i would get an email about it
oh might just get paid<$>because it's just like it's just like pocket change for them
they've been doing that for years, right<$>but they didn't do it
it's not the parent, it's a powerful in 90 subject, i think<$>because when, when it's not fine
mhm yeah, yeah, good topic<$>because i love reading
yeah but it's nice because during pandemic it's like it's been showing<$>but yeah, because you sell is fully fully remote right now, right
but uh okay, well right now the pounds doing pretty good<$>because you know canada it's always kind of going up and down a a okay we'll go up
it's like i usually wake up so late because i'd like to sleep in<$>because you're looking into the code of the catch the sun somewhere up in the air, not just moving over the horizon
you know you ski okay<$>so skiing wasn't really something you would like take your whole family to do would be really expensive and a lot of equipment and all that
it does look like here we have reached our limits, so i'm sure you have your yeah<$>because i can't see anything to end it
yeah, i haven't been to australia before, but my sister lives there, so she is in heaven<$>so where have you been to australia before
well, oh well yeah, protest<$>but at the same time we all buy from amazon and there's like, no, we can't
look at this time<$>so i would think that they've got a reason behind why they're eliminated like they are, but i don't, i don't have a clue
and then i'll do a bunch of stuff online all the way up until in other words, thank you rob<$>so what's the what do you think are the best things to do online for extra money
well mm i know yeah<$>because now i'm like actually scared of the virus when before i was like, it's, i'm going to wear a mask but i'm sure it's fine
oh yeah, i've traveled a lot inside the, you know, in the united states, but i don't consider that like try, you know, traveling<$>because yes, but because that's easier to do
yeah, i mean, i know<$>but we're gonna, we're not gonna get out of this like anywhere anywhere near
well right mm i am, i use chewy right<$>but yeah it's interesting
mm the media, yeah, come on<$>because i'm not, i'm used to like talking to my friends in person and i'm just like, wow
i just don't know that doing something without just to do it isn't gonna help anything<$>because if we, let's say we go, okay, we're going to get rid of oil and gas production
oh yeah, that's what yeah, yeah, oh, i've always wanted to pretend that and i've never like, i don't know what to do, so i've never, i would say<$>so i like i would say probably look for a game store, like in person that sells like them because they usually have space to play
okay turk review oh turk mhm okay mhm okay mm e y e okay mhm oh mhm i'm bad mhm mhm<$>so there's a website i'm about to give you called turk turk view
yeah then it was you know yeah try to more sheep than people right<$>but they also have a they also have a really low population density
yeah i'm in d<$>so where are you
it's some that's that's somehow part of this cultural heritage in this country and i don't know where it stems from<$>so where does that come
mhm cool, nice to meet you andy and benefits<$>but you know, this is where i find myself mm no, nice to meet you, wow
oh my gosh, that's funny<$>but here we are
oh yeah mm sort of i mean it's actually um thanksgiving day is my birthday<$>but it's good, it's good
and what i'm gonna matter<$>so it's like, if the observers try to adopt it, then like the brand value decreases, so like we have to like move things around
like i feel like i have a decent tolerance, but i'm not like one of these idiots, it's like how fucking hot can i make this, you know<$>because i'll eat 20 of them
oh all you have oh so you're serious<$>so yeah, that was fun
oh, they're so new<$>but she lived and they lived for so long to i don't know i don't oh yeah they were like super territorial and protective and sweet you know
yeah definitely, you know<$>but then i guess everybody's changing how they do things now so
no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure<$>so i've been doing that
it happened mm hired i think that good morning we'll see<$>so it was like a drug company and it was beautiful and he said we need to send that back, i'm not paying for it
they said you know you got to make a reservation so it's like called the bar once i want to make a reservation<$>but mhm, just, that's actually that's great, that's great
like a i see just like a finger<$>so i don't know if i just, you're back, wow
oh i see okay mm<$>so i actually lived like super close to wisconsin, like an illinois border
hey you like you're gonna hate yourself if you're in traffic you can't get anywhere<$>because you can't get anywhere well
oh, vote in the primary<$>so many diverse candidates and they get the oldest white guy up there
and uh huh oh<$>but then today she was like, i want to go to tree escape on sunday, and i don't know what it was
there's a series of what<$>because you said there was nothing
here, so i like that<$>so i like that because i get to see her, she brings my grandpa, but she obviously cannot come this year
yeah was the reagan right<$>so did you have go ahead
um i'm like yeah yeah the trans kind of like it dominates my life a little bit<$>because i mean it's a big change for you for anyone obviously
well it's been a joy talking to you<$>because if you got here for a wine, that absolutely, i'm glad that we both got to hop on and make a little money today
i'm not like i knew was<$>because i was thinking before him like what am i going to talk about
yeah, if you can, you know, i'm 46 i wish i had been smarter about saving money back when i was younger, but i wasn't<$>so yeah, it's yeah, this is, this is absolutely dreadful for a lot of people, to be honest
it looks like, yeah<$>but miami is a better speak to me
i mean they're not because they talk about and that's it<$>because like to me i'm just like nobody is talking about is like what's stopping this from happening again like
we had like a, well it was partly basics and it was partly a specific e<$>because like i love computers
uh huh but what's your major<$>so i'm like okay, i got to do that but on friday, so i currently am an acting student, i made her in many minor, much matthew or lieutenant
uh and it would be so interesting, the pandemic affecting people, like the mental health of people<$>but um i do research mostly and that's what keeps me happy
mm occurred in that<$>because like right now they've been begging for people to record like audio commands
i haven't used it in a while because i've been lazy, but uh yeah<$>so it's like you're doing prolific most of the time now
it was kind of disgusting 75<$>because you probably have a difference of opinion of warm 75
yeah there were well<$>but i've been here like i said for almost over over a year and a half and nope, i just go home when, when it's time to see them
uh, so this i'm very, how long were you a pilot for<$>but who knows about 40 years, a long time, so, yep
it is a mammoth task to get done<$>so hopefully that goes that way and you can hang out for the game and yeah, yeah, exactly
but sometimes, no, i'm not<$>because i say that you have, yeah, i was gonna say better mike when it's not attached
oh no, my no<$>so it's like yeah me i mean it's not funny but it is kind of funny after a while
we're still here eight years later<$>so you did oh so you didn't meet her at the hospital when you got hurt
they still don't, they still just show up randomly<$>because of course they do
so when that gets correct then i'll be able to proceed<$>so you gotta you gotta while yeah the immigration
going like the technical in offices<$>because like, like, okay so like i don't know how people like work in offices, you know what i mean
yeah, i don't i don't know<$>but yeah, so if he, if he gets deployed it would be in january
yeah, i would join that one<$>because it is it's good
are you able to um are you able to are you see me because i think the i can't see you right now<$>but we kind of we don't take it super simple
oh, oh, it's your political science major role with her<$>because she wasn't decided
they're like this is this interesting pattern like always a month before your passport is, do you call i say it's gone<$>so lost in the fire, you know
mhm mhm uh huh uh huh uh huh wow, interesting<$>because of whatever was going on, i think they needed them for something, they needed the workers for something else
uh huh yeah, you do that<$>but i don't want to know
oh yeah, like i mean it's on every corner so<$>because i've been to turkey to talk about istanbul
it just slows the progression and trying to defeat the virus<$>because you can have a vaccine available to everyone this year and people still not, you know, get it because they don't like it
and now i will get the first, you know<$>so like every time you do the second it goes from like, you know, 200 and beginning of the month to like 600 at the end
yeah, i've got a baby lizard crawling on the wall next to me, i don't know if you can see him<$>so um yeah, counts being early on
i just end up doing it all the way<$>because i was like, i'm not really much of like a leader
now, mm it was nice meeting you too mm and canned<$>because i think it sounds awesome
i am a member of that too<$>so i'm a member but i don't i'm not really active
oh yeah, that's that's pretty awful broken<$>but as i have support though, so i'm i'm fine
uh oh wow, that's awesome<$>but yeah i don't know
right, mm hmm, interesting<$>but it's a really good book
when i see jobs, like if i'm looking for a job and it's like home visits, i'm like no, i'm not doing there, wow<$>but then it just is a lot very draining and seeing people in really bad situations
so you, so you just like you would say it's like on my hub<$>because you don't have to anticipate anyone else's thoughts on what you're doing right
oh, because you just had your eyes open i want, oh, it was what what you're saying right now<$>because your time counter is more accurate than mine
and it is important<$>so you have, how many kids do you have
yeah which like the chess api right let's say north virginia<$>so uh it's on the coast by the water
yeah mhm exactly, so mm um i'm actually a tutor, i'm an english tutor mhm oh wow, that's so fun<$>but he could make of it
more people, people brutal<$>so like, if i'm interested in cars, i'll just use cars as like my like brand choices or something like that
do you think this is like the new normal<$>because they say best case scenario, the vaccine was like, it was like, it was like 12-18 months
the government closed them down for<$>because they couldn't quote because they couldn't even when they reopened they weren't priority
it's one of the things that got me into dnd the first that they're on campaign to, i think campaign one is amazing, right<$>because i've heard really good things about it
right, totally, wow, that's really frustrating<$>because if they do then that's a that's that's a cop out, you know what i mean
so anyway, that's my excitement<$>but i only frankly like i would have not been able to tell like right now it looks pretty great and pretty full
it's okay as sounds like kind of an interesting job<$>so you're never really, you know, putting a limb into the machine or interesting, you have to use both hands to operate it, stuff like that
are we doing on time<$>so i think we're good because it's that that's yeah
yeah, thank you, appreciate that<$>so yeah, for sure
mhm yeah, yeah, definitely<$>so let me take advantage of the opportunity
yeah, i can't even imagine<$>but it's it's a man breaking out to where i was like, man, i really don't want to buy right now
oh yeah, that's crazy, wow<$>but i don't think it's it's kind of like you know the nice way of doing things
but it's like the thought of like you know getting there is so overwhelming<$>but yeah yeah that would be a long flight, it's enough for me to go to europe to go to germany, it's basically 10 hour flight
so i don't i mean i have a good friend actually who's who's good friend got sick, she got very sick<$>because what you look mm because okay, yep
and albany is when i started getting into like tutoring and everything because i can't get work in albany because they're deaf people in<$>because they all moved to rochester
that's that's the one<$>but yeah, hi, it's egos, it's control
yeah, i feel like things get lost in which weren't easily when they're digital<$>because now there's so much calling it well even even so we still have to have a paper trail even though so much is digital
uh huh mhm what<$>because a lot of countries don't have, that doesn't have universal health care paid by the government
part curiosity got better<$>so then the one day he just decided to go over there you're crazy
hold on one second<$>because i can't hear you ups, hang on i got it
oh how did you get her tomorrow<$>so she got arrested me
what kind of attorney do you do<$>so i was working for a big national firm defending um, yeah, it was like employment law
i like mhm oh<$>because you know corn tortillas have a real strong corn flavor
and who are a joke right now<$>because we have like what
okay, let me try switching to different um mhm<$>but i don't think that make a difference though, because it's just through uh the uh what you call them conversation link
it's a little extra spending cash<$>because i was thinking it was like, maybe for something that's like since a lot of people are on video chats on covid during covid
yeah, it was good<$>because all the restaurants, everything was closed
i don't know what is<$>because at the end of the day you keep going because you want to lose what you already did at this story
mm whoa, yeah, mm oh yeah, i heard about that over on the west coast<$>but yeah it's a lot scarier to protest than it was like a couple of years ago
yeah, but you get snow every winter, right<$>but that's about it
okay, what song do you home<$>because i mean i have that common problem where you end up hearing song, right
yeah wow, that's wild<$>so no after school activities, unless it's specific
well, i'm cool, very cool<$>because they have like their own um, dashboards, stuff like that where they could, you know, check their cells and stuff like that
mhm uh huh mhm mhm yeah, i'm sorry mhm mhm no oh wow, mhm mhm oh yeah, yeah, well looks so sweet<$>but my cat, my one cat bochy, she's a dark calico
yeah, i, i've watched it for a moment<$>so did you watch the debates the past couple of days
uh huh the city, it definitely seems those with you<$>so another one i get hooked on, you know, it's terrible like tv so much you know
uh so have you been there your whole life then<$>but yeah, i lived here my whole life
well that's a bummer<$>because yeah, it was just kind of it was just sad really
yeah that's that's what i've heard a lot about it and that's what makes me a bit mhm<$>but the loop, the loop isn't the loop is like this its own country
i mean also, you know the thing i'm worried about in offices is like air circulation because that's the air souls, you know, they hang around right<$>but um now in her case our all of the people going on the same day, is it going to be too crowded
yeah, i think you're right<$>but one is cute
is should not well then she already she should<$>but she should have a good um for me like when i talk to my husband about it i think she should have a better grasp on her students
some of the southern part of the united states, wow<$>but that would have been cool
yeah, i don't know how to do that<$>so like, i don't know how to read sheet music
but that's still really very i feel like now the government is kind of like over this and the government is just letting the states do their own thing<$>because i know like if a tenant doesn't pay rent, your landlord can't just cut off your power immediately, you have to go through like a proper eviction process
yeah, i yeah, yeah<$>so what goes around comes around, what about you
that's that's so weird<$>because yeah, coming up
no, he's 20 that one<$>so that's a about the writing
yeah, i liked it a lot<$>so this was on prolific, wow, that's awesome
so excuse me one or do you like to travel or<$>but yeah i do i love to travel yeah
like i just can't even yes, they're all yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<$>because they're not strong enough
mhm, mm uh huh mhm hello<$>but yeah, how are you
but i really want the year<$>but she also didn't follow the car and dice
like i went, oh my god<$>because everybody has the same idea
mhm and, mm, mm<$>but i don't know
they does to acknowledge it<$>so this is like, it's extremely like widespread and deep rooted problem and that's why trump, can we can't get rid of him, right
i don't know about that though<$>but but then by getting covid and i'm just like, yeah but i'm not around rabbit raccoon, i'm around people apparently more than that, right
why don't we please<$>but no, i mean too many movies
yeah, i heard about that, wow<$>so for $15 a month you can play the latest games
not only no, you know, they changed a lot of that, which is unfortunately<$>because it's not really paying anything, never only paying like $150 a week which is not some
uh you know, i think really until this weekend it didn't really fully hit home<$>but how are you dealing with all this
i'm talking about how to make money on other sites<$>because you didn't give us any guidelines
they were it was just they are they still around<$>because crystal, they do drive through
so i don't know are you like for the foreseeable future, going to have to work from home<$>so you were saying the midwest is spiking, we've got to claim the fame of the first state to a million
not only do i have to do the homework, but it's like, are you in school today<$>but yeah, that's yeah
i'm, i like it like it's half out, but i almost looks like i have a widow speak<$>so you still, yeah
yeah probably not here because they're going to new york and also selling expensive tickets usually<$>but if i would be in like any other part of the country i could probably get tickets for a decent price
actually, i don't know whether they enjoined me or not, but i really was injured<$>but you had a good time
were just there, it was just in it was that's exactly the deal<$>so yeah, everybody that's one role because it mhm uh huh yeah, i want to go say some shit that i don't think
i'll uh kind of central<$>so i miss it out there
i think i am<$>because i was, i don't think i've actually ever yes
okay, yep, nope man<$>because there's no work study if you're home
um yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's very different from california<$>because there are a lot more outwardly of it
better i there you go<$>but yeah and i could yes, because you went from like uh he said you're taking like a computer science like classes, right
what what is it cancer<$>but it could be, it just looks really bad right now
yeah that is true but it's true like honestly and any country would be better than here for now<$>because my idea was i'll probably be safer, safer in european here
so you have to think about this<$>because of the pandemic, that's awful
but i really liked working for them<$>but you gotta get, you had a good experience and you would you would recommend it
yeah, a little bit, a little bit, yeah<$>but do you collect a lot of merch for shows and stuff
so yeah, so let's take yeah, it was awesome<$>so interesting that something of a tradition also
so they're like we're going to stop operating in california completely because we don't want to classify these people as employees<$>because then they have to like pay them better and treat them like actual human beings
well, it's i know what happens a lot and it happens for all different kinds of reasons<$>because like, i know there's some, like, crazy people who just want to, like, like, they meet one person and they're like, all attached to them
that way you can actually have stuff<$>because then hopefully it'll be over by the time you were on the job market, right
yeah, it'll be worth it<$>but that's what i wanted
she also did one on pedophilia in the united states<$>because i think sea duty stacy
yeah i have no idea<$>but um, yeah, you said you don't know what you, you don't know what you want to do
like i literally could not like not drew on myself until yesterday<$>because you don't yeah
okay, did he marry<$>so he had been 58
like what are you going to mention<$>because like my friends and i one year we did like nickelodeon characters
so it's more variety<$>so if if someone is not so good at dancing there on it, like do they get a lot of people watching their stuff
oh yeah, probably guilty of that<$>so i think that's what i did right
exactly yeah there's all these conspiracy things like oh like all this stuff is going to die down after the election<$>because how can that be
or i don't think we understand home orders, but we are like most people that i know are staying at home just you know, to be cautious<$>because like i work from home pretty much now
oh, you just graduated<$>so um cost of 2028
that's just no because he's a packer and actually he's only won once in u<$>because because he beats the vikings
yeah, i enjoy it<$>so um i've been staying with
i mean of course you get bored sitting at home<$>but oh oh yeah that's okay
i had a one sided conversation<$>because i did it the one time i got stood up or as one guy says, i got left at the altar and um mhm
so when i visited terror, i i enjoy the blizzards while no one else does, but other than the snow, i'm like there's nothing here, i'm not coming<$>so do you like skiing have you skied before
oh i've actually heard that to know he um he said that his only symptoms during for the cough but no shortness of breath<$>because i've heard that's another thing that kind of lingers with people
i, i feel like the trick answer is first, but your second because he passes like where you look<$>because if i say i put first because i'm, you know
it's a hard hurdle overcome down especially with jumping<$>but yeah, yeah, we've been trying in the bathtub to like pour water over her head every once a while to get her any more used to it
fuck on someone, right<$>because that seems dangerous
yeah, don't worry, don't worry about it<$>but it's kind of free time
yeah, all right, sometimes frustrated, like, right now, like, i have set a goal, i'm like, i'm gonna write 1000 words a day and it's so simple, 1000 words<$>because because you can't not so yeah
yeah, i've definitely done a lot more online, you know and things like these surveys<$>so so we do have our chatting online anyway
yeah you done anything<$>but then since yesterday i didn't get any throughout the day
i yeah lose anyway and i found out you can like do things like that for money<$>so what do you do it just for a little extra income or it's just fine
well, humans keep this, you managed to keep this job with just about everybody else in your industry<$>but yes, i've been through a recession already
no, i didn't hear that<$>because there's two once
you don't handle right<$>but it was crazy
uh oh yeah dialogue was fun<$>but yeah, because i just like when i look back at it now, anything before like 2004, like the dark ages with dialogue
so yeah, yeah, i mean some of these people though, i don't know if i want him in this country, so maybe, you know, uh we'll see, we'll see<$>because i mean i feel like he's trying to start a civil war with what the stuff he's doing crucial
that's what i need to do then<$>because i said after two days you got to send them a message
um oh oh yeah that oh that's weird, that's really good mm<$>so i always look at them and say oh my god they are very beautiful
apparently there's people that hike the whole thing<$>because it kind of goes inland the further south you go right yeah yeah
it's not it's not the evaporated one<$>because i love you right
well, oh, i've had, yeah, right<$>because if it was, i'm like i would be outside all the time
is the drive through that the brain are, it's a brand new car or if it's a convertible then you're in trouble<$>but i don't know how to feel about having random animals coming to my window in the car
yeah mhm mhm right<$>but yeah, i mean i've mostly lived a normal life i would think
yeah, well that's sad definitely i'm sure, mm<$>so i don't even know if it's going to go back up
i'm kind of sad because i don't have a, yeah, i don't think i kind of like the labs and retrievers pretty like standard stuff<$>because you want a dog is every time you want
yeah okay so yeah mm<$>but she was a trio of a jack russell
the family is great and the family is great<$>so you have a big family here
but well her her on site job, she's she works in healthcare policy<$>so what does your wife do we, you know before you said her job may not come back, but okay, okay, cool
i assumed these were more academic in nature and not<$>so big firms like pr i or quinnipiac
uh huh yep, yep<$>so that's important those people
so i know it's like when we're out of sports came, it bothers me when i see adults, like, can i have your autograph<$>because you didn't care
yeah as um yeah you got earthquakes, you got landslides you know<$>but then again you know you guys have hurricanes and we got earthquakes
if it's close then whoever whoever is on the losing end of that's going to be thrown<$>so if if it's if it's just for naming sick, if it's a biden blow up the trump, people will be like okay, are doing lost and vice versa
um what's your cat's name<$>so bingo, there's another one named lucy but she's not so he just left
you can get 1299 a month<$>but then i would probably be on there all the time by a nonsense
and then i would stay with my family in colorado but literally like they've been under evacuation orders so often that um, it's like because of the fires, yes<$>because of my wildstein
yeah clear and mhm<$>because i'm actually i literally learned how to use photoshop like a month ago from my class because we're learning dreamweaver, photoshop and animate adobe
i thought it was the heat<$>but apparently it's like they want to be mimicking what you're doing
oh yeah you are not the doctor<$>because they were like, why don't you tell us
mhm mhm oh that sucks, i'm sorry what<$>because um i actually didn't qualify for unemployment
do you live like in a more rural area<$>but most i go to school in omaha and then i also, my work is based out of omaha
from what do you do<$>but um i work in customer service in a billion department for an insurance company
of his club window<$>because are you on a phone or on a on an ipad or on our laptop
yeah, if you if you go on reddit and beer money, that's it, that's how i learned about that beer money and the penny hoarder<$>so that's like it doesn't add up your money
yeah, ridiculous chunks of money<$>but but it's it's well it's like very i would feel like believe driven you know and what is the belief that you want to happen
yeah i know they have such dramatic ways for other people like that<$>because i think it's just her
it's wild was and that's the only place in the u<$>but it's still, yeah there's still like tons of people getting sick, is it because i thought that washington also had maybe like california
mhm yeah, no, i didn't go to him but i can definitely imagine<$>because like that what
it could be, yeah, yep<$>because there was something to complain about whether your boss always
yes that couldn't yeah<$>but yeah they said that that tends to happen as they get older
so yeah, all right then<$>so you know, that's never completely reliable
uh huh oh wow, it sounds yummy<$>so i took a lot of the things i learned from college about how flavors work together and what not layering
do you use anything other than sandbox from politics, you know<$>so i use something on my phone
and then are you going to stay, i'm going to stay in the united states<$>because i want to do my my exams because i've done my medicine from pakistan
give her, yeah, overhead<$>so you cut a lot of the overhead on that and you just, you just deliver through, there's like six different delivery services
what are you studying public policy<$>but i'm planning on studying public policy
um so do you have kids or<$>but like no, no, no, look at three
so very much so, very much so<$>because i was thinking california
yeah, she's really pretty<$>so yeah, pretty much
yeah, i'm like, oh, that's yeah, but like, almost every single math class is almost always filled up<$>but some part, are you taking any male classes
oh, thankfully you are safe<$>but yeah, yeah, like you know, you're uh prognosis of your heart issue before kobe coming along, you know that was that was a blessing
well no, you really do<$>but i i really need, i really should though
are you like enter the nba<$>but yeah, i really do like basketball a lot
and it's a yeah, just mhm<$>because otherwise you might have them so that they never end up getting it
i'm like wearing a teacher<$>but like we've been getting a lot of like cold weather lately
oh, interesting mhm mhm<$>so like looking at how companies are successful or what sort of change, like what sort of things are indicative of success in the future
they're not able to make the lawyers yeah<$>because i know some people are trying to reschedule like for the fall and now we're like, well the fall it's not gonna work
yeah yeah for sure wow<$>so i've gone through a couple bigger hurricanes, but it was a long time ago
mm yeah, it's a relief<$>but it also be nice to just be able to be outside for like more than half the year
yeah the last, yeah okay so yeah so what they did is this one is paying like 15 something in pounds<$>because this is my first time in it
right, that's a great idea<$>but the thing is gonna have a really powerful like big industrial conviction of and so like i get and it's like 550
i have because i'll end up going to sleep<$>because they were oh really good
yeah, i'm not sure couchsurfing, it's not as popular with americans as it is with europeans, i know that, yeah, i'm in grad school at the university of pittsburgh<$>so what do you tell alcohol
oh yeah, i don't know<$>so i thought they were going to get to me because she doesn't play the piano
oh my yeah, you got to do work on on on your desk and all the time you got to be online<$>because we're technologies that we have zoom meetings and stuff like that
mhm oh, i'm in dirty<$>so it's like it's a really simple puzzle game
yeah, i think it has been about that<$>so yeah, that's good
are you going somewhere else<$>so i, my grad school will be at georgia tech, but it'll all be online, so be anywhere
oh, you love it<$>but yeah, i am extremely guitar singer
mhm mm, mm hmm<$>but i'm just focusing on the positive side
but i think the south, yama, swimming, the south has like, you know, superior barbecue compared to new york<$>but yeah you're right, i mean i don't but that was a long time ago i lived there but yeah i don't remember that being a thing wow
is your family safe<$>but then uh yeah, but you know, it it's just basic instinct
particle i don't care about that<$>because is to get really mad or whatever
how do we get black but not be able to work anywhere and everywhere<$>because my kids today are spoiled
all right i think, yeah<$>but it's different for like there's different schools in a conference who are gonna have been fully in person and then there's others who are continuing on
uh that would get very hot<$>but i do yeah, i just really don't want to work out in my backyard anymore because i'm just like less motivated
i don't hey you remember my english name, remember figure out what your english name is<$>but i know this has been it was fun, does i
uh mhm so yeah<$>but for compositing people still use after effects really professionally
yeah somewhere around there or you know yeah upward yeah upward takes a giant fee out of your cost to if you earn anything on there<$>so like and they take a massive cut and so it's like of course you know because why wouldn't they
that's the thing like take all of them down and then you know put them somewhere and give them medical attention so it doesn't get worse<$>but mm, no, and yeah, especially if it's a lot of them, i guess to a retirement age
so it didn't work out there, which i understand because they made the the rules very quickly<$>but i guess it's really just like you said, it's about like where your passport and visa say
but well it depends on what type of software website you're using<$>because like i've never really played but because you have you have it's all about like having physical cards
if it's like two days a week and they split the class in half because my friend teaches 4th grade and they're like 35 kids in her class<$>but those schools are not necessarily starting right away or they're doing a staggered approach where like only have the kids come each day
mhm, mhm oh yeah, well, or your hands<$>because they gave me, they gave me gloves, right
i think that's a growing problem these days probably<$>because kids, these states, they don't know how to talk to people
anything mhm mrs yeah<$>because then you could do that just locally and kind of see the effects of it
oh, that's so funny, wow<$>because i yeah, so we made it work
yeah, certain i just turned 22<$>so how old are you
oh girl i'm 48 i feel like i just graduated high school<$>because i feel like i just graduated
oh how nice conference nine oh i'm in san diego california<$>so where do you look
and i'm not i'm not going to do that and all right, no, please go ahead<$>because our vote is our privilege
well when you work for a company that makes coffee makers, you almost have to drink coffee<$>because to have the experience enough to tell your customers how to deal with all those things
yeah, no, i hate it, slightly less on fire<$>but yeah, so right now we're just kind of, i'm looking for a job
yeah, but not at the cost of someone else<$>but you know what exactly exactly
that was my first question, like, how big is that guy<$>but yeah, and i know he's unusually playing
i not really no, i mean i barely use my desktop for that<$>so aside from over watching you play anything else on it
oh not too good<$>so has the virus, has it affected you a lot
yeah broke her back<$>so possible she jumped she did it herself
yeah i can hear you and i see that you're wearing the blue shirt<$>so uh well i'm glad you uh glad you were able to to join
no, i don't know unless they marry a rich guy or something<$>but yeah hopefully though, you know they'll find the people that you know that uh soul mates are there for you because you want to be hungry
um, so i just never knew what it was like to live outside of home because i'm just used to it<$>so when do people move out when they get married
you don't want to<$>so that's why i'm just stay out of it
yeah it was a pleasure talking to you tonight<$>so i am fond memories of community college so it's i enjoyed it and for me my goal is to teach not to research
yeah, that's uh huh<$>so um at the time i was like hell yeah, i'll lose £20 if you sign me
i bet that's cool<$>but yeah, i stopped and got the crest on the way home that was followed on my day
i wonder how uber is able to stay in business with shit like that happening<$>because they are making money off of the drivers so if somebody wants to keep driving like what
and we're just shy at that<$>because amazon just um or opened um so the amazon building just opened up
we watched a lot of baseball when the world series was on<$>because it was played there right
yeah, i would love that's what i would think<$>because like some parts are like super steep
mm and yeah, you, mm hmm<$>so you have t
it's not like there's like a, like a pringles can lying somewhere and then like mhm um uh huh yeah<$>because that would just be garbage
totally because 2021 is going to be a bust basically<$>because we still don't know if we'll be able to operate normally
uh, the mother is going to die or something<$>so it's i don't know
oh, learns all the way<$>because travel very similar charter
yeah but if you're saying that everyone is out now then i don't know how that's going to let impact the thing<$>because right here it's sunny and hot so that's why people are just going out
we're just like yeah, pretty much, pretty much<$>so we're just driving through your boring town for the sleep and we'll be on our way with the dish
i think we can cut it out now i guess<$>because right when i i came on right at 10 o'clock and you were here
but well, oh i sure did, i'll be working on that in the coming months<$>so you gained a little bit away during the thing
i caught me on<$>but like if you have that degree it's not super useful for a whole lot of other other things it turns out
he does he like he like he just like the wall pitch you know he just likes to watch football<$>but actually do what
let me like czech girl mm oh no<$>because that is that's right
i can't out of there's eight of us<$>so how many roommates do you have
i remember i i think they kind of rushed it, get it out and some people were nervous about<$>because this is the time like yeah
i wonder how much there will be continued investment in that versus how much we'll see things start to switch more to wireless well, cool<$>because you have towers obviously and think about 5g
mm i lived in england for a little bit<$>but because my second ex husband was a british national, i did live with his parents in england for some of that time when he was deployed
event they didn't like four years<$>so that night yeah, i don't know if i can call that a hobby at the moment
no, they closed down the beaches to them<$>so they did for a while
um yeah i've never been i've never been there but i'd love to go<$>because there's a lot of outdoorsy thing surrounded by water that are not of hiking
well, well when the homeless people sleep, i mean i know there's a big tents and stuff on the grounds<$>so littering in the train stations on the subway
right that's great yeah mm<$>so it was nice
any like hobbies i guess<$>but yeah, so my new thing has been biking and that whole like try to get a bike thing
ah what that's good it's nice<$>so she lived in switzerland uh in new york and all all over the place
uh huh yeah, i have that out on also<$>but eventually that voice just started telling you and i like that voice say it, there's a survey ready or whatever he says
i was fine with that<$>so what do you think about that
so because the match, wow<$>so i was a computer programmer, software guy for the longest time, that's what my career was
yeah, i'm allowed to talk<$>but like i get it
yeah, yep uh temperature outside um no it's 50 for right now, but it was it was up close to uh was 68 yesterday, right<$>so in this government means from okay 68 now
it's not as bad as it was this group<$>so somebody was like delivering bricks ahead of time and everything like it was getting out of control
mhm oh yeah, it's hard to get everyone on the same page right now<$>so it just their understanding
there's no memory whatsoever<$>because i was, but i don't think i did because there's so many stupid videos out there like, you know, oh, is this real life
it's like you don't even like i'm doing the homework inside when i'm like this to to nonsense and get a quick quick dollar survey<$>but yeah why not
i see you but mhm<$>but anyway, and if i ever get up to chicago, i can't drink anymore because i'm diabetic
mhm do not look good, that would be really nice<$>but i think we only got three more days, i'll get to see them
i'll definitely check that out<$>because people say like on twitter in different places like oh i don't believe that
and uh all right<$>but in the fourth season she gets shot like right in the middle of her head by the security guard
and if the liver stops working the whole thing of all<$>because they yeah, the whole organism like, oh yeah, crap can
yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not the worst thing<$>but it's like i'm alright not knowing anyone up close that has it
you know what i mean<$>because the ones that shouldn't get the disease
yeah i have done yeah<$>so what made you move to the us
yeah, yeah, it's a lot are surging again, so yeah<$>but i want to give it another couple of weeks before and and just just see what happens
all right, okay there<$>so you don't have to go through a dry patch much longer because it's uh yeah, man
well well yes they are<$>but yeah, she's really sweet, she's black and she liked to keep up korean pop music and he was like uh thank whoa
i'd say another maybe 1-2 more minutes would be<$>because we started up
okay, check that out<$>so i would definitely suggest that if you ever get hulu, i would suggest what we do in the shadows
uh well, i mean that's it's good for, i guess<$>so it is good
um and for them they just thought it was probably the best for both of us to stay home<$>because both of you could have, you had the option of going back
but then when it comes to baking, you have to be, it's a very precise thing, you know<$>because with cooking you can kind of adjust the taste like as you're cooking
well that's not bad if it does all of that<$>so it felt it was a great investment
yeah, i'm glad homeschooling is great<$>but it's gone good
perhaps i it's not too bad<$>because i thought it was kind of expensive
yeah, it looks really content i guess<$>but she doesn't get marika
numbers are going up and i don't know if it's their testing more or if<$>because even if you look at some of the numbers, like i'm trying to explain to my mom, she's like the numbers are growing up in testing more
yeah and caramel aren't interested<$>because we just said that yeah, we used to sit down on the steps and everything and now there's nothing i said
wait so you said your cousin is so much younger than you and he just graduated<$>because it's like yeah
so if, yeah, big difference going from a suburban area to this<$>because i'm i'm originally from new jersey
no, no, i know what you mean<$>but actually political careers are celebrities now and it's like i get that they have important status that doesn't automatically make them a celebrity
um mm yeah, that's really cool<$>but he's the one that prolific tend to be short
so yeah bullet yeah<$>but i hope to get rid of it soon
are you married or anything okay<$>so i have a long term boyfriend
when we uh i didn't i have my phone next to me and i just saw it for yeah, same here<$>because i know i got on like a minute or two after, but i'm not sure
during the no, that has yeah<$>but other than that, like you're just like doing research most of the time
yeah, i'm not wearing that<$>so that actually might have been that actually might have been me because i was the one asking everybody through
alyssa melissa, nice to meet you, how's it going<$>so us going all right
i'm just gonna set a timer for us<$>because i'm always like, always end up looking at the clock and being like, how long was it
we're done like there's a uh all right<$>but whatever, you know, they'll see that list
what about you have any other hobbies<$>so i love, i got into making bread before the whole fad started with, everyone was like snatching up the yeast, so i was really frustrated by that
yeah, yeah thumps right<$>so um which my daughter does, my son just like what, he's just a boy, like whatever
okay, well, y'all not legal, y'all need to get the hell out of here, but you can't get steak and he's the united states citizen<$>but i don't yeah
see i'm worse when mine gets longer<$>so he asked, right, yeah, electric grid like chickens
see i'm gonna jump into the pool so yeah<$>but it's good fucking to it
oh, so she's in her 70s<$>because he has even spoken out and said he's not going to appoint liz warren anywhere because she's too polarizing, which is hilarious to me
no it's it's insane<$>but yeah, it's like the whole midwest is just bad right now
so what do you do<$>so when we had rehearsals, i would lead rehearsals, i would be the one giving notes
okay yeah, i'm sure mm<$>so i was like, yeah, i should try to be doing music
mhm oh yeah, yeah, yep, there you go, it's fun<$>but in the end they would just teach you how to read japanese, that's great
right, right, yeah, that's my biggest problem too, yeah<$>but it was good, good and bad like working from home i guess
ah i keep are settled<$>so i would have to color the whole, i don't know
oh, more of exploration<$>but you know, i guess that
having affairs and stuff and i don't want no part of that<$>but you can get married
uh huh what mask on<$>but like i do, i know, i know
oh wow, okay, boom<$>but i mean, so we're in about the same
yeah, it's nice to meet you<$>so i'm like you came you came on like 8:00 so i can't imagine
the oh, that's so cool<$>so i was like that is cool
they just don't but i think especially if you want to go out like go party, it's a good place to go<$>but then i guess it's pretty much just do the right thing
we got 25 minutes to kill we might us<$>because like i accidentally click the arrow on my tab
hopefully definitely agree on that<$>because if this doesn't it becoming a zombie virus, i'm just i'm jumping i'm doing i am doing it, i'm not dealing with that shit
depending on which list you look at in terms of population<$>because i'm thinking of like when i think of bad traffic i think of like l
what part of new york<$>so yeah, i'm right outside
yeah, i mean i feel like a lot of like university students are probably then also go community college now hopefully<$>but yeah, that might, that might happen
yeah or um we moved to a state where they're just starting to their opening up pretty quickly right now but a week ago they weren't opened up<$>so did you move to a state that's like like pretty opened up and there's not a lot of restrictions or is it like yeah
so this microphone is really can be really quiet<$>so mm it sounds great right now, how are you
i feel like it has a lot of people on it<$>because when people have like nasty down here
so they could go around like that<$>so we have a lot of rooms like that
no, no, no, no, no<$>but it was very comfortable
oh yeah, mm that's good<$>so i enjoyed it
yeah now decatur i think your barbecue country too, aren't you<$>but we have some pretty good marketplaces around here
yeah, no, i, i believe, you know<$>but yeah, i'll send you that
oh yeah, drought is going to be a lot worse there too<$>because we're real dumb and we refuse to wear masks and stuff created
no, i oh, a lot of different variety of<$>because the other two ladies were forming taxes and south carolina
that's a good question to hold on<$>because like i was here like about five minutes before you showed up
that's my yeah that's my mango<$>so you, i guess your main focuses do public, i didn't know if you want to go let government because the transportation that's always needed or something like that
yeah, which is fine<$>because i want to talk about, yeah
oh it's ridiculously good, it's reasonably long<$>because i feel like a long oh
uh he was going good until someone threw a molotov at the police and then it went crazy<$>but i don't know
yeah i made it through ah you said user user testing<$>but yeah, like user testing
uh oh, i'm sorry what, basically april i was i was ready to postpone back in march<$>so sooner, so when did you decide
mhm basically lounged around and stuff when watch tv um uh it was a mixture of stuff so<$>so what do you do with your day then
what my spirit, mm no, go ahead<$>so how long did you okay, go ahead i say
but the rest of your 75,000 doesn't get you much milwaukee either<$>so i don't imagine you're like, i got the cool kids
mm i believe it up with<$>but after about two weeks they completely gave up on standing and they just have it at their desk sitting the entire time
it's 1 31 now and what<$>because i have a meeting soon, but it's good to talk to you
think about you're just selling room<$>but it's so different on zoom and it's just hard
and that's another site that you can post blog entries<$>but well, oh, what
that would be a nice yeah<$>but i'm going to go
yeah and over his<$>but uh i got to say, but yeah, i know, i know
uh huh oh yeah<$>so it might have been dissolved in the california
um yeah, i'm just just working<$>so what were you up to
oh yeah, it's definitely that that makes sense because i can see that<$>but yeah, and then do some of the locations don't make sense
is it average 5-7 that they require them<$>so yes, well they spread 10-7 or i'm sorry, 7-10
yeah, i bet order in the summer is like the worst<$>but it was really hot down there with the humidity
i mean yeah, i mean that's hitting there<$>but i not already seen he married a really good friend of mine
yeah i mean yeah yeah yeah<$>so i kind of wanted to raise to lose and also they don't want anyone houston to win because they screw the yankees with cheating and all that stuff
yeah i see company about it to do that<$>because you gotta dedicate time to that stuff
um yeah, at the yeah<$>so that'll be interesting
i mean like when you go to college<$>so i don't know actually because i still do dorms because i prefer them
like she's going to see my little notice or like a homeward bound<$>because like how can you not bring up uh animals just walking around
mhm yeah, i'm not judging<$>so the first thing that came to mind was i stole your sign right out of there
uh yeah, it's a mhm<$>because like with consoles costing like hundreds of dollars now like you can get a good piece you for like $500
but yeah, how does that conversation go<$>so i'm scared about that, but excited to get back to work
