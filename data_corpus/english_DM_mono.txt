i think it's just it's just going into the like a quiz part of it<$> so uh i think we could close it but it was great meeting you and talking about cats
no it really is<$> like some of the states you just want to take them out
 i mean, w w great if we could for both survival and just cool factor<$> but yeah, i don't think we're there
 i used to be a cop<$> so i do a lot of uh i would say
 they are in trouble too<$> but i don't think people, people have just become ignorant
 here's the copy faced<$> but hi, i'm becca
 i had a lot more when i was younger, i think<$> but like now it's just it's easier for me to control the classroom, i think
 we have like okay we have an infantry museum because i'm next to fort benning georgia<$> but that's like the only music and we have a very small local museum
i think they are closed for too long<$> so if they want they just opened what we can say right? the government allowed here
but yes, the barbecue in austin, there's a whole culture for it<$> but yeah, i would stick to those two cities
 he really doesn't care<$> but you know why i bought that eye cream
 he was doing like a video job<$> well he was trying to do a video job while talking
 yeah, i have sex<$> so it's giving me soon once i got and i'm really happy about that
we didn't have enough people to actually go live<$> so that's why i'm home
 like that kind of stuff<$> like i think that's worth it
 i am now going to be 50 in february<$> so oh thanks, you look great through and um but you know, mm mhm
i have one that just turned nine and then one that just turned six<$> so they're in school right now
 so tommy, you're not in trouble<$> but i think it's important that, you know, pornography does not accurately reflect adult sexual behavior
that was aren't too bad<$> like i've been out there to see nurse sharks but i haven't anything that was too big though
 and i got a call back in like an hour later from the nurse<$> like you didn't give a reason, is she sick?
 it's like three hours to oklahoma city, which is dallas is like six hours away<$> so yeah, okay, so the screen froze up
um but when i was on holiday it came just for that<$> but that's like 2030 years ago, 91, sorry
 you know, even in like a dunkin donuts which are, you know, very big, whatever stuff like that<$> so yeah, i don't know
yes, he's very old for a cap and if he comes out he will be me allowing very loud<$> so don't be startled because he's just me
so they have to kind of take it, you know, in a matter of time<$> but um uh no, no, this one, they didn't pay for any vacation
 i don't think the congo is the safest to go, but i'd like, i'd like to go<$> so yeah, those two probably aren't
they closed all the rest stops<$> like when we first started, i'm like, what are people supposed to do?
you kind of suck<$> so you tell me you'll come, you don't show up
 and then if there's anything left over that goes towards other things<$> but basically a lot of people it frustrates maybe
you can't go anywhere<$> but we're lucky about people wearing yelling and complaining but they're wearing them
 it's also the signs of like capitalism, i'm a big anti capitalist and those things have just aided<$> so like i'm worried about the american way of life
 yeah, it's pretty fun<$> so you gotta switch then
 i really do appreciate you talking to me<$> so i nice to meet you chris uh yeah, chris
 like the frames are like 12 or something like that<$> but my prescriptions like really strong
 my dad had some issues later in life<$> so i had to help him a little bit, you know?
and that's kind of a broad purpose<$> but you know, i always knew i wanted to be a mom
 are you doing your masters or your phd or? okay, gotcha<$> so you'll be there for a couple of years, three more? gotcha
 but even though there's headaches, it's still worth it because i love to travel<$> so that's a big positive
i think like as far as jobs go, every workplace is being pretty cautious<$> so like they're still remote everything
oh, that's what we're great grade levels do you teach? oh okay<$> so at least there
let me get your pizza<$> like that's basic require it
 where it's a 2029 right now<$> so we started to call at what?
 love dogs but cannot would not be, i can't keep plants alive<$> so they but they're too like the family i take care of
and t and then it gives me nothing<$> so a t and t
um, i'm really sure what the testing, honestly<$> but um yeah, it's easy to do
 so he's eight weeks so he's actually like still like a baby<$> so he's either completely asleep like in the deepest sleep ever or he's running around at full speed
those are unique names i love<$> so what made you discern?
 i have a shaved head exception piercing and a girlfriend<$> so i mean it's pretty close
i just got a few more to give you that i'm done<$> so for market research groups i already shared with you pvr encompass which are only in atlanta
 once that he got stitches<$> but he are the neighborhoods as well with a 12 year old has a german shepherd uh white german
 all that was crazy<$> like i'm a huge louisville cardinals fan
um, and they're all special needs kids<$> so they're really, you know, just really hard to do that
 she moved out while you were done<$> so she moved out while you were gone
 and after that here is kind of just up there like babbling<$> so like he didn't have any stats
 i'm not the end of crumb<$> but uh do you have like um like alexa devices in your house? um all right
 i don't know if any of our areas person has been died yet<$> so i have not heard anyone to to be going
so if that happens to you, that's a mistake<$> so all you gotta do is contact the researcher
 i'm a math teacher and i teach statistics<$> so i, i like doing surveys
my best friend, they hit their family had eight children<$> so it's kind of a common thing in that area
 so i love a mandarin chinese<$> so it's a great, a little bit
and this was when we had our baby<$> so of course there's pacifiers and all that stuff now
it could take up to a week for her to find out<$> but she started she went last weekend
 there's an arrow at the bottom by the time or to continue it<$> so we should be good
 while you're young too though<$> so how old are you?
 it's been pretty good actually<$> like it's not as good as prolific but it's pretty decent compared to the amount of time
 i have um like a 92% acceptance rate<$> but i've had i've had just over over the time i've i've i've screamed out on accident before
 well, it's never done with any favors<$> so i got a george bush and so i think it's time that we got, but mhm
 he can pick, pick stuff up like that<$> so he speaks like, i think he speaks like sex
she, you know, she loves that so um but you know we can't do it now because it's closed<$> so she's been playing basketball
 and then there's like three actual big like normal hospitals<$> so i work only with the medical staff
 uh let's see i had like a friend of a friend's kids got tested positive for it<$> but you know, it was like pretty isolated it seemed and and the symptoms weren't too bad either, so
 um, we didn't get married until 88<$> but yeah, lots of lots of ties to texas
 yeah, i spent a lot of time in on and randall county<$> so a small bit of time in howard county
yeah, they just want to make them happy<$> so um the person you're in a relationship with, do you live together or do you live separately?
 then when i go back, i leave to live today, i come back home<$> like my aunts are like kind of like uh stressed out
so, i mean i hate to bring politics into it<$> but all the red states were because nobody wanted to wear masks around here
 i hate that we're in this predicament<$> but yet here we are
yeah, i'm looking for a job<$> so right now i'm do nothing
 so was the last semester<$> so let's spring semester we worked on html and parts of python
my mind's at 2027<$> so i think i think we've hit our quota
but i also think that if it was a classmate it would be really awkward<$> like if it's a client who's like coming to me for like services like that i'm providing professionally
then i came back after an hour and it was still there<$> so you can do it later but have the window up
 then everybody is like, oh no we're fine, we're fine<$> but then we do have this same kind of problems
yeah, it's kind of crazy<$> but that's like the worst that it gets everyone throughout some sleep
 and now he's going to be a veterinarian as well<$> so it's a lot of work
unfortunately the cars recommends me like the sound basic cars before taking that one<$> so i chose the basic one and learn
 but fortunately her school's back in session five days right now<$> so although kids have the option of being online in her class
mhm yeah, i really don't like going outside<$> like i've been outside like three times to go to like a pharmacy to get some medicine
so i like middle school in high school but i don't mind teaching elementary<$> so uh what do you do as a did you say research assistant?
 so i definitely want to try that<$> but that's really interesting
it's more there has to be something else mixed in<$> like have you played uh area?
 i'm like, oh, that's great, it's a horrible time for that<$> but that i want to try some good rahman and i love, i love to try some good robin
 did you, did you have any project for your finally or do you just two classes? nice<$> so a lot of account thing or do you do more like to heretical economics
 um it's a cash back app<$> so like when you shop at places you get cash back pay p
so i'm part of the marketing team<$> so we do all the digital advertisements, um, stuff like that, anything that's audio, video photography
 yeah, i thought it was pretty cool<$> so i'm planning on doing it this year too
like even even from island to island would be way too far<$> like we have like eight islands and that's will be like amongst that
 i mean, yeah, you could buy a how you could build a crazy house for 100 and 50 k<$> but where are you going to work?
 this my mom lived in detroit and it's 12 hour drive from minneapolis to detroit on the freeways<$> but i always like to take one way i want to do a circle when?
 like i don't want people to just be like, this is good because that doesn't help me<$> but yeah, in like a space with strangers, i'd be a lot more afraid of people just being jerks
i'm already on the fifth one in a week<$> so i got that accomplishment a lot of lego
then you don't have to include the past trials in your analysis<$> so it doesn't make it doesn't make any sense
so i've always had rhythm and loved it<$> so i will freak out
the soviets turned the south soviets maintained power as they had each ethnic group fighting among themselves<$> so they would invite the soviets
 well try and connected with english<$> well like japanese with english subtitles and i start trying to see what words i can pick out
we use the digital character sheets because more room<$> but yeah, so like, you'll take notes from session
they're they're bringing somebody up<$> so i'm like, all right, well this sucks
 you hear about all the people that get on and then no one else is there<$> so yeah, my name is program i want to, i don't know
i've done yeah i did the last round and there was only one time there was a guy<$> so that yeah that's interesting
 i've been wearing i wear them for like distance our night driving<$> so when i go to the store i put those on
 i think last time it was bad too<$> but it's just like oh really?
 uh we we do with a lot of data as well but i love the data guy<$> so so we have a data analyst
 and the only thing they had for guitar was classical guitar<$> so that's pretty much how i got started there
she introduces me to like movies and tv shows all the time<$> like i didn't really watch a whole lot of movies
like there is in each country in europe<$> so i feel like nobody wants
so because europe is so you can drive a couple hours of being a different country<$> so it's very easy to travel to multiple countries at once, like on one trip, which is great
but i think they want such a straight talk<$> but yeah, i'm currently like my name is alexander, cute songs
it's just kind of batshit crazy conservative<$> so yeah, a little rough
 still put a chill every deal<$> but i think i speak all the time
really? for me it's like i met all three of them were like maybe all the foreign that cheese<$> so i get just random
 um yeah his real name is jeff cavaliere<$> but yeah so it's like a th lean ex you know um rimington james is the food guy
that can be a thing<$> so what do you do you in school? you work?
 my grandparents don't do anything<$> so that's really nice
how you just call it the cloud<$> like it's some monolithic thing out there
i'm like, okay, we're kind of annoying<$> but then like, but i was able to tolerate it
 and all of her friends had early last names and she had a later last<$> so yeah, it's frustrating, but yeah
i'm just now getting around a white $28<$> but again, i started last week and i was at like $4
 once i ever figure out when that's going to happen, i got engaged like forever ago<$> but then i started grad school, so i've been too busy to even think about getting married
 i really feel for him<$> but man, we, you know, look at places like new zealand that was just like the end you're done
 you're like, i worked on 15<$> well here we are
 you cannot make money<$> but like it's nice
 but anyways, long story short they take the load and then they take the output<$> so like how much people are drawing, they'll put more energy into balance it
so that, that part of kansas isn't what everybody else pictures, you know, just flat farmlands and everything<$> but you go outside of that immediate area and it's exactly what you think of
but then he also works a lot with nuclear energy<$> so when you have nuclear energy, you're going to have a byproduct of i guess nuclear waste
mhm yeah thank you<$> well it's a message yeah
and i did that for two weeks<$> but let me tell you before i left, i went shopping and stacked up on all my groceries
 yeah rates will definitely probably go up when school starts because everyone's moving back in<$> so i i hope so
um it's gonna be weird to like they also honestly told as much information like it is online<$> but i think we have anatomy
 he was on i 81 there's total kind of truck accidents all the time<$> like it happens inevitably
 like your political choices affect your personal life<$> like i am here, i am your friend
you flagstaff for you phoenix<$> so it's hot down there
okay mm clinical psychology<$> so i'm talking to psychologist here
and it's like we got home and i had a migraine<$> like it was crazy
 so i'm reading it over or like they take maybe it's a mental thing<$> but i feel like they take even longer
you know it's a pretty rough time for that<$> but yeah i was looking at like accounting or um something like technical related computers
i feel like lately i've needed like way more humor than usual<$> like i can't really watch that, like the intense stuff anymore
 is that the latter implies that perfection is the attainable goal<$> so you will always be left disappointed
 i think it's, it's like a bad precedent for the future<$> like what if this like same thing happens like years down the road?
 i believe it's called black companies<$> so the company is black
 and i just know that if anything happens you know before it was always the case<$> well you know leaving side the prospect of laying down a couple 1000 bucks
not much we can do pass that<$> but all right well my name is claire, what's your name?
 it's nice to just make a few bucks<$> like if i buy a coffee or something that day, just like cancels out
 that kind of made me sad<$> but yeah, i guess
 but then it's like nothing for months and it's a waste of time<$> so that's, that's why
 so he's in school 2 - three days a week<$> so at least he's in class
and then 2020 days after i graduated, i joined city council here in macedonia<$> so i'm at the council meetings anyway
 are you kidding me? that's waiting while i'm up in rhode island<$> so hey you're looking at a flight and like everything else staying with relatives
so that was manageable<$> but like some people their parents or, you know, you're right, all right
yeah, i'm gonna guess have a timer like on that screen that says 18:30<$> but i think that was going on like yeah
so like, it's like circus e stuff<$> so what it's not
no, no i'm not<$> so i'm teaching in, it's a suburb, like a northern suburb of chicago
you don't like them, you know, too bad<$> so sad for you
back in the perfect<$> well it was really nice talking to you
 i heard that they're getting rid of splash mountain<$> well they're not getting rid of that
right? i like cheese tail<$> so what do you do, i mean, what do you do out there in wisconsin?
 a change of location can incite certain things and you can make you think something is better<$> but hey, at least at that point you actually have a comparative experience
 well it'll i'm sure it'll all pass hopefully sooner rather than later<$> so big news with the vaccine the other day so and so yeah, boom
 that's literally the only thing we've done all summer long<$> so how are you, how are you guys keeping yourself busy?
 so disney did make that a sequel<$> so i'll say last jet
so yeah that's that's the saying<$> so usually when one come is not too long before there's another one so you know just enjoy them
like i did one<$> so i've done social security numbers, i've done prayer requests
 so um it's pretty neat and all days<$> so nice because it's such a small store
 so he would essentially do his math on the computer<$> but that costs money for a district
she has a lot of help<$> like a lot of her colleagues are in health care and that kind of thing
 so everything builds up to the erotic part of the what happens<$> but i wrote it i wrote it and i said i maybe should make this into a book
she does, she does like really, um, a lot of the medicine she does is very like groundbreaking medicine<$> like she does like deep brain stimulation surgery for parkinson's disease
i feel like if we have a dog it should be small<$> so we were like looking at chihuahuas and i found one with like one eye and no teeth
so just go over there and he's a lot better<$> so now what he does, he comes home for lunch and we'll work out together
 i'm in the car<$> so i hope, i hope it's not the background isn't too crazy
 so maybe, you know, that's probably right<$> but there's something else
 like we didn't know how to do anything, wouldn't have anything<$> so now we're better
well, i can't see yours right now<$> so i think your connection like that because i can't see you anymore
it's like impossible to find those costumes right now<$> but yes, that's great
urban texas? oh, okay<$> so different kinds of hot but still hot
 it's like, good for you though<$> like that's amazing to be able to do anything like that
don't get me wrong on that aspect because i have a whole thought process on that<$> but yeah, i don't know
and then i rode my bike well just for one year of it<$> but you know, it just gets so bad in the winter out there
i want to move there<$> like i'm i go to you and see now i'm getting a phd
because i'll eat 20 of them<$> like no, no one, no
i use like a duck duck go instead of google the search<$> so i guess my default so it's actually on that browser
i did what all my friends said was cool<$> so let's realistically think about this here
so it's called respondent<$> so if you google respondent you just set up your account
 um, but it was good<$> so what part of nigeria did you say you were from delta?
uh it's been great<$> so how old are you when he came here from ecuador?
this place is horrible<$> like they were just totally that's how people are, that's how people are in this joint
so like i just barely used it and i just use it<$> but i'm like i played buying crafts and my friends, i'd like fortnite very little
so yeah, he was the guy that in the family that could fix anything<$> so he didn't, he didn't, he didn't pass that along with me
 while i what? yeah, it's true french tyco shirt<$> so we're gonna keep in touch throughout the world series
a lot of people at my job have been working from home<$> but we are not the lucky ones
 i mean and i'm seeing i mean obviously the election is in the news mostly<$> but i've been saying i mean our case numbers each day are just going higher and higher
um, it's, it's a huge company and um, i started on like working from home<$> so i saw my boss one time
it's kind of like my like dream job and my like dream job within that is like curating exhibits<$> but at this point i'm like anything, i'll take anything to get an art music
 like i don't want anybody to pick on you because the color of your skin<$> but i would really like to have starbucks
especially with people that realize the issues and i mean you're out here educating people<$> like i had no clue about half that stuff
 but or like i told you the coffee filter or crazy stuff like that, like that's not gonna work<$> but i am, i'm very paranoid because now i think it's going to make it make it worse
i have a lot of random stuff that i like on there<$> so do you have a favorite, right?
accredited and shut down within a couple of months of each other<$> so like my degree wouldn't even mean anything about actually earned it
 so anyway, it's good<$> so not much, which is actually nice
 she used to what you want<$> so how to fish
yeah, i don't think so<$> like all that talk to my manager and my team leads all are like till december
 but i mean if we pick them up, our offense will be totally unstoppable<$> so we already have two great wide receivers
 oh this is early for you<$> well in today's world this seems early
 it was that's why we got to do and then we at least caught one<$> so how far from the ocean?
 i do so much like off the bench stuff too<$> like we we're play catch, we play board games
 it is what it is<$> so do you like your house?
it's kind of nice<$> so we'll just like, we'll just take our time and take a long walk
 i went to law school and pass the bar while working full time as a police officer<$> so i'm not afraid of long hours and putting in hard work
 not as soon as you you got it<$> but when you can
 my best guess of why they missed it is because of the size and how close it was<$> like certain planes can fly literally under the radar because they have to try to be detected by radar
like even when i went in the bathroom, it was a surprise<$> like i heard moaning whirl
 it has time gone by really fast for you since maybe like at first it was kind of slow<$> but like the the end of the year is just really came up like fast for me at least
but when it's online they don't really care because the person they really do<$> but online that's a problem
yeah, i was out in california was before all the cameras<$> so it was like the 90s
 but my husband's actually a therapist, a licensed therapist<$> so he became one when he was 50
but in reality that's kind of not i don't think it's the right way to go about it<$> so bubbles, what happens, you know?
 like i just hate working with customers<$> like i don't want to do that definitely
 survey is a little hard to get through<$> but they send you stuff all the time
he's like, damn, that sucks<$> but you hate it when it happens because it's like yeah
i still haven't even figured out what i'm gonna do my dissertation on<$> so open to find something that'll grab my interest for the next 4
i'm like all right, let's just do this thing at 11<$> so i'm a little hyped up, but i'm here uh ice the core is x men
we're just, we're just nice midwest people<$> but then that's, i mean in the city is a it's crazy
 your, hey, i thought you were supposed to be back until tomorrow<$> well i wasn't, but wow
 oh, so good, so good<$> but mhm oh yeah
 so he doesn't have that interaction with the teacher or anyone<$> so it's a little bit different
 he was a street cat rescue<$> so he was a little bit malnourished for most of his life
 i think it's mostly like companies to do those two<$> so it's just like um trying to like advertise to you make it through this thing
 you can start filling the shift of the weather<$> like this morning when i got up it was very foggy out
 but now they have opened everything<$> but and i see a lot of cases rising as well
but yeah, to your point like not everyone lives somewhere where it's like really isolated or things like that<$> so it's the best of it and whatever that reality is
 oh my gosh, i lived in charleston south carolina for one summer and i loved it<$> but i was like, i feel like i'm breathing underwater like it is
that's i was the latch of the knobs<$> like did they just tease it open? yeah, smarty, let's go silver
i don't know how well that's going to go<$> so we will see
i mean you got to be educated, you gotta be smart, you gotta gotta be good<$> but you know obviously if you're like, you know your store manager like a dollar store
 um to fly internationally we're right between probably slightly closer to atlanta than charlotte<$> but greenville has a tiny airport here that while all over the united states from cold
 but i don't mind<$> so i'll just pick up if i can make an extra 60 or 70 bucks on prolific every week
and so it's been it's living in the bay area ends up here<$> but it's been fun
 and part of, you know they take this place to be a pleasant place<$> so when they built it there was still yellow fever and stuff from mosquitoes
 that's why they're applying to work where he's at<$> but they have taken people who have only ever been like a waiter at tgi fridays, right?
 so i went on a friday and he's like, it just got here<$> so it was still frozen
i would like to have the balance<$> so you went, you went from the city to like, how far are you from the city now?
 i just i definitely see people all over each other because i said i'm in that neighborhood<$> so thank you tens of people i see, wow
he uh he says if i get it i get it, there's nothing to do about it<$> but then he mentioned that he has cats
 it was a little too much too much stress for me<$> so i, i gave that up
we went like two months almost without somebody now they just had to positive cases on my floor<$> so i was like greg
and like all these rules<$> so we work with these other people that say this is exactly what you have to cover
 it's not really done<$> like you say, it's like one finger
i i like having four seasons though<$> like having no, well i love we got like a ton ton of
 yeah, we're not a very populated states<$> so there isn't a lot of incentive to put a lot of those everywhere
 she wants to kill her parents is what the topic was<$> but she never for anybody try to do it
oh, i know, i know<$> but yeah, i know
so i got them back and nay and it took a while for them to start obviously<$> but it's been nice because i can be home and right after this i should go water them
 but i wonder if i'll get it next year<$> because i imagine that
 it probably started to die down a little<$> but then yeah interesting
and he's a hispanic man<$> like pro queers pro you know everything
it's gonna be really good<$> but i could, i could see people like not like ingrid ellen arc
so i have python now<$> but this semester i'm taking java
yeah, we christian kids want a laundry goes<$> so we, we had our own type of like science fiction
yeah, they just wanted to talk, have a conversation<$> well they have a they have a timer and we're at 21 minutes straight now so
yeah, because i'm just looking at it<$> but yeah, i think i think we hit it
 so and it's fresh water so it's it's not salt water so it's it's very nice<$> but yeah i mean michigan michigan is good
 well, and i miss my parents, but i can't go visit them<$> so here i am killing the same room i knew my work in
 he works at a plasma center, so he's been working<$> but he tells me like the people, they don't have their noses covered on the bus
 i'm going i'm going blank because i like the movie, the movies i like are a little different<$> so they're they're a little on the very extreme side
and we put the car gift cards, we win in each of the slots<$> so we have our binder, we'd go to to, you know, say, hey, we're hungry tonight
um, and only a few will do that<$> so you want to try to find those
and i completely forgot how that works<$> so i ended up having to kill it by ripping this
so it's already confusing enough<$> so they want to make the whole state just one time, right?
 so for the most part, i mean i'm used to the big city, so this is really small<$> like the nearest bus is a s
 that's actually even a pretty great time<$> but keep it active, you know, a pretty great time to go back
 my doctor the same way i realized i left my other dog in a cage<$> but um all right
that's what they do with the graduation photos<$> like they don't give you a real suit
yeah, she had her baby<$> so all as well
other, some countries are bigger impact than others<$> so when a country that's not big on tech is forced to go online, it can be heavy
and they look cute the whole time<$> so you just take the whole time
internet speeds not quite as fast<$> so whatever they're doing, the servers aren't working as well for them compared to work
 but like it's yeah, you're okay, you're good with that<$> like it's super violent but it is a great book
 that would probably had some pretty good information in it<$> because obviously trump didn't give a damn about it
um city our state<$> so i've just been and it's cold, there's no reason to be outside
bird what most people, well, their season just ended<$> so i don't know exactly
you know, a teams call or or a virtual call is just a backup plan<$> but now we're all getting more comfortable with it, you know? yeah
 just i just i just like the feeling you get from probably solving a question something you don't know<$> like probably they talk about like diffraction reflection lights waves or these kind of things
 like it's so isolating and whatnot<$> so you do? no
 everybody's home for tool and i'm like, thanks<$> so she was bombed
the bachelor pad or something<$> like a lot of star wars posters, maybe
plus it's so hard to fuck good to player board games<$> like we've been struggling so hard to find something that for two people but still fun and like challenging
 so that was really pretty<$> but california was mostly wooded
i like really like the website compared to other websites, like other reports just look so sketchy<$> like they have like add yeah
 so yeah, i didn't say much actually till now<$> like a lot of uh
 we're complete sports nuts<$> so mm uh huh
 it's 40 for my daughter<$> so yeah, i mean she's got scholarships
 i have a second monitor on my computer set up<$> so i just have like a window open up all the time
 i guess i don't have kids<$> so in the future i'll see that
 no, it's pretty bad<$> so my actually my sister graduated from u c l
 it's an opportunity that we met here<$> so that's why i don't want i just want us to keep this friendship
i feel that it seems like most people are starting to be interested in like the medical field<$> like more people getting out of high school and going into college
 you know, i can afford a computer and things like that<$> so i'm going to probably get one here soon
she's like in a city too<$> but we're both working from home and it's like a lot being stuck in the apartment together
 you got to set it up where like you pre screen the shit<$> so the study is just show up the people that are going to get it
 there's no way they don't go up<$> so y'all wasting everyone's time being stupid
 so like what, what makes an animate different from like another like animated show<$> like i know there are some like stylistic differences
 i was thinking about that recently<$> like with all the students stuff like hearing what the colleges returning, like just the living living situation
it was definitely a lot more difficult than i expected it to be<$> but i've been staying at home too and um pretty much used to not seeing family all the time
so i gave her a night like and she still uses that<$> like all the elsa stuff that she has is gone now
but i do recognize the fact that every single day, uh, that i am putting my life at risk<$> but then i think of folks that are still right planes, i don't drive a car
 uh if i go that way, there we go<$> so we had this this collar on her because she she's got the same
 i'm like, oh no<$> but i knew kids for sure
i know a lot of other friends and you know they're people's passed away<$> so it just got so crazy that we had refrigerators
 the job is further away<$> but the thing is i live about it takes me 15 minutes to get to work
and honestly it's craigslist<$> so 95% of the answers you get
yes i know what you're doing<$> so yeah that's that's my life
so he puts the crops out in our fields<$> but he runs, he runs the land off of us
but like, you know, that's your sense of smell<$> like what the heck is? uh yeah
 they only go up to like about 10, 15, between 10 and 11, maybe 12 ft long<$> but those things are vicious bull sharks, they're vicious
um, making sure my, my dog just wanted dinner<$> so keeping here fed
you saw that? um she produced it too<$> so it's about a good girl who is now trying to become the bad girl
 what uh let's see<$> so you're down in maryland?
yeah so um um games um apparently people like having me do hot sauce shots too<$> so that's the thing okay hot sauce shots
i actually really like the movies like silence of the lambs and red dragon and all that<$> but the union is pretty good too
 in in our area, even when the restaurant opens the bombs i think is never open<$> but the restaurant was open for some time but it was only outside
so um you know as stuff goes to clearance process or price changes or anything else like that<$> so he works sunday through thursday from 8 30 to 5:30:08:30 p
yeah, down the road<$> well hopefully it'll go away by then or figure out how to deal with it
and i never they were like friends that i met online<$> so like i never met them before
i mean i live near austin so it's like kind of different<$> but did you, this is a kind of a super question
yeah, yeah it is all i need is a computer and internet access<$> so yeah are yeah, yeah there's give and take
 but i mean it's probably different when you're living there, you know, the vacation obviously<$> but you know, yeah
like there's just so much like sensationalism like you just can't trust like one singular source<$> so i'm just kind of, i don't know, i'm just kind of like chilling at home
 there's a place called sandy hook<$> so i drove up to like sandy hook is like like the point
 so then i'm like, okay now like you're sucking the youth from me, like go away<$> like i need to go get some moisture edge
so you will get 20 and you will get 10 or less<$> but you want those recommendations
 i think it was like if it's yellow, if it's black with yellow stripes and that's poisonous<$> but if it's got the yellow and the stripers black, i'm like, if i'm that close, i'm too close
 and like catch up on the fact that like she's not even like a wake for school<$> like you got to put your foot down and wake her up
he's more like a 3rd 4th grader<$> so he was very frustrated because he's like, what mom, what i had
 um i mean the state's been cutting aid to the whole sunni system so it's probably gone up also<$> but i just know compared to private schools in new york it's hell of a lot cheaper
 well i definitely love having this specials on the background on netflix<$> well i'm doing stuff
i got to have more in common with you than the other two people that i talked to<$> so this is the one girl was a teenage girl and i was like oh man i'm struggling
i mean it could be like five years later, we're still so grateful<$> like thank you so much, by the way, this app doesn't exist
 well it's mostly just like computer games<$> well we've been playing like among us lately
but i but i like the creativity<$> like we we we could end this thing if it wasn't for our own dumb samples
 so it's like i'm not going to risk myself<$> like sure my generation can do it if they want
 but that's something i really been enjoying<$> so it's just regular
 i was just gonna say we have like, we have each other's orders memorized<$> so we'll just like, you know, run by a pickup spotlight
 so she has to still go out every sunday uh to the church<$> like even though there are only like eight people there, like only dog master and some of the musicians
so it was kind of like we need to deal with the flu<$> but we also still need factories open
so, and other than wisconsin for awhile, went to school in wisconsin<$> so i love wisconsin is a cool state ever get a chance to go up there
 you can see its first yeah oil painting on the canvas<$> but yeah i am planning to do more cans of things
well, i'm on my phone because my computer<$> so this is the problem i had is my computer just uh it won't charge suddenly
 like all of a sudden magically at the end of the year, all the shit's going to go away<$> but i think 2021 might be worse than 2020 man
nobody seems to know any real answers<$> so we had blocked them all
 i hate to like i don't know, i've been like a pessimist about that before<$> like i think that is kind of life
i'm 100% i'm boring i guess<$> but i don't mind them
we like just recently switched wifi actually<$> so what do you suggest?
is like something else you will be doing right now<$> like if you really like doing software engineers, there's something else you would like to do
 so then it was just mail under penn state<$> so yeah, i went to penn state but now i live in living memory
 i think we've got i think 100 cases or something like that here in the city<$> so we've been pretty fortunate
um yeah they don't have them consistent at least from what i've seen<$> like i woke up on like sunday at like six a
 it's not like an academic survey, anything real<$> so it's kind of a scam i'd say borderline
yeah, it's boring as hell<$> but pays the bills
 been really busy since quarantines rolled up too<$> so it's like it's paying for the beer money
and the president, i'm hearing a lot of good stuff about it<$> like a couple of my friends were like it's it's great
 i'm in i'm in missouri so it's rainy here which is unusual for july iranian like 75<$> so i'm not complaining for a midwest, july day, almost august, so fun
 i got the flu<$> so i've been home for three days now
 you're just like, i'm gonna go ahead and throw this up there and it's on<$> but i don't know
i work out like five days 56 days a week<$> so it's hard to say it hits everybody different
oh you can online you can do online study<$> so i i chose for my doctor pool online
right? he sees everything, you know, the good and the bad<$> but i hide i hide the bad parts, you know, from my friends or you know, so yeah
 i was like, oh, i'll do this, i'll have enough time, i'll go do this<$> so like, because i also, i live on like on the ocean, on the ocean
 yeah it can be very complex like it just depends upon where you're working<$> like if you're working some place that has a lot of infrastructure it's not bad
 existing would have been so drastically different<$> like if if any other major world power except the us
 grad school is so expensive<$> so yeah i got really, really lucky
they just wanted to stay<$> but isn't it so different though?
 i kind of didn't say anything<$> like i follow that that beer money site like some people will post like how much they made them
and they're like, yeah, it's great<$> but everyone here is from north carolina
oh it's hot here<$> so i've had my hair up
 you know, very sad situation<$> but i got two brothers, younger brother and older brother
uh those would be the big ones<$> so what about you?
but i think i think his mom would be okay if they ever wanted to move down<$> so because she just moved closer to her mom
we didn't do much anything else<$> so now that i'm, you know, living on my own, it's a little bit different
some of the older generations at least that was my experience<$> but i think my aunt, she's just really really strict
 you know, i'm not that old, but if through the country younger people than i are dying<$> so it's, you know, it's just always a concern
i was like, i have a six o'clock call<$> like this can't happen
 and so it was very intense<$> but like tuition was also very expensive
but i know and what would you say? oh, so like, yeah, yeah<$> like there's nobody around here so we're not really affected
 maybe we are before covid 19 last year probably<$> but then all the stores are closed
 yeah, like that's about it<$> but i would never really take it seriously
 i would say it's one of the best like cost of living and quality of life<$> like you're just like, i mean like, i know it's not like the same as l
oh yeah, that's a good idea<$> so many games that i don't want to by, but i want to play
 it actually hit like an all time high of new cases like this last week<$> so mhm and uh huh
 especially since this on he was pulling oh my god<$> but when i came around that corner, all i saw was a juiced up
 um i'm also a little further east<$> so yeah, we get winters
speaking of coffee, i'm a little little energy today, but well, i'm here<$> so you have, do you have one kid? do you have more than like all the strong name?
and this is my third time<$> so yeah, i'm not new to this
 i think it's probably cause i have to let me see china yourself<$> so i heard you before
but you can nowadays you can learn languages quickly<$> like in one or two weeks you can start programming
 and um i'm getting deeper into that and develop my own business<$> so i don't i don't have to do anything but my own business eventually
 so yeah, that's good<$> so what are you hoping to do with your degree? like what do you want to do someday?
but see the empathy<$> so that's part of user experience is like understanding people
we went to most of them except for like some of the midwestern ones<$> like i think kansas and stuff, but it was cool
 and she cut us off from her um, 2001<$> so i hadn't seen her for 15 years before she died
 we had spiders all over the place and i'm just like, okay, fine<$> like you wouldn't bother me
 dollar is stronger than the canadian dollar<$> so it's like the opposite because you everything is cheaper in canada kind of
 yeah, i'm actually moving out there towards norman sometime within the next year<$> so yeah, it's where, oh you is
 yeah, i don't know<$> so this is, yeah
 i think it's fun at the people i've met have all been awesome<$> but you know, there's there's nothing that i can think of
like i've been sitting here waiting, i'm hungry, you're already late<$> so i never tipped until after
 he's waiting for his food<$> well he's no he's no i'm in the family room and he's in the kitchen
 the members of the band are spaced out<$> so i hope, you know, all she could do
 but i love my job when it's a lot to stay for the duke<$> so if i don't have to go in there, i won't go in there
we should have already had to buy now apparently<$> so i was like all right, coming, all right
it's just proving to be an asshole<$> like it's like it's just a map, you can breathe
no, no sense professional, you know<$> well put together they're tourists
 she's like oh now i'll have to buy some more stuff or more cloud storage for this<$> like just use the sd card
and then they bring the address on the envelope and the postcard<$> so i do kinda like milk heart camera and help running the machine
my list only gets bigger<$> like i saw knocking things out, but at least i have the list
this is not my expertise<$> so you're on your own on this
oh that's so cool<$> so they're both over there are they living with your family or that?
 he's a mad card investor<$> so i forget what his last standard his name is
and so sometimes during like the really bad times there wouldn't be enough food<$> so they give them hey
 ohio wait i iowa i might and they're all the my my mental picture of that area<$> like i don't know where any of them are honestly, which is really bad
 and so i sent them a message and stated that he did show<$> so i don't know what, i don't know
i just hoping that one day the hotel would disappear<$> because i was thinking that we are we are kind of settling announced everything and then post again
but he was really great<$> but you know, he could have learned how to post up
so we we enjoy that<$> well sometimes turn it on an afternoon during like quiet time that time
 so after this i'm going to go to bed<$> but it worked for me today because i can do webcam
well then it just makes me feel old<$> so then i'm like, okay now like you're sucking the youth from me, like go away
yes, just in case you forget<$> but i'll email you
uh huh it's okay<$> so you do you have any pets like your person?
 no there's like no other close gas station right there<$> so i'm like ok i'll go here
 like bedroom or living room<$> like those are the only two options and like it's getting yeah
 and uh so i just uh i pretty much keep busy every day doing something<$> so what about what about you?
 and uh yeah, i love i love little rockets<$> so um i know you know that soon coming from chicago, it was always like a vacation
but i think it was okay<$> like comfort animal or something
 i wo okay so so interesting<$> like i said how they set up that kind of whole whole whole scenario
we have regarding, we have wood burning, we um do maple syrup and other things<$> so we've always kind of been more towards self sustaining
 like, i'm wondering like right in the middle of jersey, so that's sort of convenient in terms of cities<$> like we have newark, but like really anybody in jersey would say our main cities, new york city
she's a substitute teacher<$> so whenever she doesn't feel like working, like she doesn't have to
 and honestly i'm still with energy because i'm like i really needed to work<$> so uh tomorrow i'm working 72 2 p
 well i think my first plane ride was i was probably 16 and i'm i'm 37 now<$> so um but got to go on a few
so i'm like, like what? like you get free, like not free, but it's basically free money<$> like you just have to say you like a product, you know or whatever the question there
i hate that question<$> so i always have to keep that in mind right now
 they didn't play nothing this year<$> but they're going to open schools back here, i guess
i just snuck away for a little bit<$> so a little bit
like this was the headline that would dominate the airwaves<$> but let me let me bring you one further
so um i never really had experiences<$> so this was kind of like a blessing in disguise like during the pandemic and stuff like that
 in january the coldest you know it definitely snows<$> so it's a it's a cold snowy winter here
 only people i personally at our people i know or in my inner circle<$> so i have like like only about 100 maybe friends from so many years
 they're all getting like automatic ized out<$> so we have other things to do
 i have more time to do stuff<$> so it's hard for me to just sit down and not do anything
 so yeah, black section two<$> so this is the 6th 1 for me
she's got this big, you know like plastic thing in farmer face<$> so i figured oh wow
oh, easily, he's okay<$> so he's eight weeks so he's actually like still like a baby
 it's not like it kind of makes you go around the same areas too much<$> like the old, like the over world, the over world is kind of stale
 but i still really like to get a professorship job if possible, doing this kind of work<$> so it'll be like palestine analysis with like scientific background and domain knowledge requirements
but it was like um i'm also sick<$> so i play like um religious music
they email you and say oh we have so much to do<$> so if you want to go over your hours please do
 i failed, i've pretty much failed school<$> so high school was not, i i got straight sees the whole time
 you know i didn't i never knew that that's what they would use for those consoles<$> but i suppose it makes sense
so i paid it and it was brutal<$> but then we got to reduce it, i got it down to about 1200
 well i didn't care about your singing, i'm just letting you know<$> well it doesn't matter
i was probably 18 at the time<$> so young, naive available
 it might it might be longer<$> but i mean it depends on the whole situation
and on top of that there is also physical security<$> so like we store every all that date, all that information on paper inside is safe
 i tried to do this two days ago and i waited for a bit, then no one showed up<$> so glad that someone did
and there's if i go all the time like right now i know it's gonna be packed<$> but what they do is they have lines formed outside where it's one in one out
 yes, can't not let these people tell their stories somehow and put it out there<$> so i did all the social media's and i'm all ready to go
but they paid me the first time<$> so i think i'm going to stick with what i know
 that's such an irresponsible, it's like okay, it's fine<$> like if you believe that then you know, ultimately like that that's kind of on you
 i'm like, this is ridiculous<$> like there was no, i'm working from home, but they want them in the office
 i just yeah, i know that, i hated, i hated it has to be against the raw<$> like i wish the tables would have turned
 it's my brothers, but i couldn't get my bluetooth to work in the past two or three of these<$> so i'm using a usb headset that looks utterly ridiculous
 like i don't even think i've seen someone have my story before<$> like it's just it's very a lot of fun
 you know, and the governor supports me<$> so guess what is coming here? it's like really okay, i'm gonna make sure i'm hiding at that
 uh huh this last year<$> so that was pretty fun
 and this is when the terrorists had<$> so this was so this okay, so sorry, this was around i think march
and i like this style of twilight princess the best<$> but i just think like the design of ocarina of time just replayed it so many times
 it's just like rice better<$> but because we're asian
 i to actually see the game itself<$> like there was like a chat that started to pop up, it didn't, not everything was loaded
but just something about it<$> like just, just insult me
 so yeah, it's just crazy<$> but i think that um, the governor here definitely opened too soon
yeah, that wasn't too bad<$> so i haven't done what, at least before i do does this happy?
so then she should bones sticking out of the front of her both of our lives<$> so she was in shock
 or if there's like a problem with the survey sometimes that you can message the requester<$> but do you feel you don't get a response back and i'm targets one once in a while
 everything was good and i sent it out to this dude, it was like $20 or something<$> so it was whatever, it was not a big deal
we have done it yet<$> but really i i'm not saying that time it's really 25
 i know it's gonna be weird when we go back<$> so the office has maybe 3000 people in it
i work for you<$> so yeah, it's just just really you know
 we have been able to do that, you know with unless you know, in the past two decades<$> so it's sort of newer in a sense than computer science
so this is will be the seventh actual conversation i've had<$> but the first three times i matched nobody showed up
 oh no, that makes sense, that makes sense<$> like what if i don't get achievements, things? yeah, i have a different issue
so we have a teenager with borderline right now and she exhausts all of us<$> like this kid derails our entire group
 at least you're able to go outside and be able to walk and you have space like that's awesome<$> like i'm in new jersey and i used to live in new york city and i am so grateful
