you guys aren't building like battle robots and going and fighting other robots or<$>well that would be really intense
that's a good yeah<$>like you can't have a job and that realm because you need to really focus on your studies for a while
uh, yeah, yeah, not too long ago<$>like what like two months ago
yeah, i'm in the us, right<$>well i'm from southern california so i'm pretty much born and raised down here
what do you do<$>oh i do my partner and i um co own a plumbing company
you don't want friday and saturday man<$>like i'm just like, okay, it's a disease and it can make you really, really sick
what do you recommend to do that<$>oh um definitely visit
so we should just, you know, see what others vaccines he's going to pull out of his bag<$>well i think you know, maybe like a treatment or something like that
uh he was the best thing was he was just as my age, so we had a lot of experience<$>oh yeah, that makes a big difference i've noticed
yeah, they're kind of puffy with like brown or white chest, like a black back hydra<$>oh i kind of, i kind of know what they look like
yeah and yeah still worth it if you got i think it was like $3 so certainly worth it<$>like it evaluated me as the leader of the four and i was like, i literally did nothing
so it's like orange colored and stuff<$>oh my god, that's awesome
so i think maybe maybe this is the start of a kleptomania<$>like i was putting a fiction otherwise you get too nervous and like, like exposing, i'll be like i was shoplifter
i hope you thinking like diseases i guess<$>like rehab the fucking bury, who knows
uh huh right, right<$>like he i find that easier to relate to than being sad
like the chat window<$>well i guess so
uh oh yeah sometimes sometimes sometimes you're cutting out, the voice is cutting out on you, my connection is fine<$>well i that's strange
but so so you don't generally see any cases that have like juries or anything<$>oh yeah, we we have very uh yeah, we have jury trials
so yeah, they took there was no blood getting to my teeth at all<$>oh i've never heard of that
you make someone more money shit<$>well there we go, i'm just gonna airbnb this all these apartments all have with this future fake money
yeah, pretty much when i was a kid, i used to get actually blown over by the wind and rain and windy rain<$>like this is terrible
but yeah the answer then like there's just memorizing a formula kind of thing<$>like their comprehension of why it is and not just the repetition of learning the answer
i think i think mail in ballots are going to be an interesting process um with helmets, a government is like messing up right now<$>oh my god, it's gonna be a nightmare
so how, how has it been going<$>oh i know it's amazing
and if you're going to go to school two days a week you might as well just go virtual plus<$>oh no, that's nice
it just like uh stopped<$>oh no, that's fine
and it kind of like, hit me then i'm like, they're literally saving lives and no so much information<$>like it doesn't yeah
yes, i'm in north carolina but i'm originally from pennsylvania so i've always been on the east coast<$>oh yes, i'm in school, currently a sophomore in college
i am sorry that you're busy<$>oh yeah that's true and then some people are just don't even realize what they have
i feel like they're just uh away from religion<$>well uh yeah occupation
but even the ones who used to travel internationally haven't done it in like 30 years<$>well grandma wants to think about the money, but honestly, i will be like 50 years old before if i had to wait for people
no i actually don't<$>well what do you like this school
right, mm careful in the long run<$>like i don't think anybody any other the democratic candidates would have won against trump, but they probably would have been better candidates in the long run
yeah, and it's like actually affordable is the best part<$>well that's a big difference
and he asked to wait for me peace way, just what because we do<$>well uh huh and he did uh huh this you just gotta power mhm
p e r t i s e<$>well sorry, we have to give that to me again, life
yeah, it's always on<$>oh my god, that's yeah
all right, i'm mhm<$>like how are we going
uh huh mhm mhm you know<$>like two of those cheese sticks, you gotta really like cheese sticks like cheese and people aren't into it
i got a daughter, she's a go ahead<$>oh i'm just saying that i've been doing that one and what's the other one
uh well i know some javascript i think i was good at uh javascript<$>oh yeah, i just i just know those are two other programming things
if you type their name into their you'll see all the reviews for them and people you can rate them on like the how good the pay was<$>oh all right please yeah mm
uh huh i guess the problem is is not as much the school, it's everything around them, that's how they get out funding<$>well and you are exactly correct
yeah, mm hmm, wow<$>like they don't have as big of an off season in the spring
back when the hockey team was the best time<$>well where would we be going back
no, i found out part way through when he was gone<$>oh my gosh, yeah, that would freak me out
but i usually, yeah, wow<$>like i i probably they're probably sick of me talking about it, but it's like my favorite thing to do
that this is the way i look<$>well i think one of, one of my favorite quotes is if you won't stoop to pick up a penny, you don't deserve a pound
that's look it mhm yeah, wow uh uh so what type of shows do you normally watch<$>like i would sit down and i watch it and like i have to catch everything
i can't do it like that<$>oh that makes it difficult, that makes it difficult
so is it really cheaper<$>well my electric bill went up $30 from the same month last year and my my water bill was up a little bit more
and then you just leave it there and then after we're done, you like um yeah, you answer questions and stuff<$>oh and that's the time that our i'll carry the
so the talking to a stranger can be a little awkward, more awkward for me even<$>oh our yeah yeah i i completely get that
all right, okay, that's definitely an issue<$>like who are you trying to impress
why do you ask<$>well because i'm a male life
actually in january and you know 450 so far isn't so bad<$>well you have the, do you have the extension browser on the thing that notifies you of like service when you're not around
i've never seen one faces<$>like i have this one friend, i'll call her like every single day you think we run out of stuff to talk about for support
it's still kinda oh yeah<$>oh wow you're in the opposite corner
may as well take some extra money<$>like okay, if you're on survey says, you know, you're like halfway through and then they're like, sorry you don't qualifying
uh yeah, you wouldn't even look at me<$>oh my god, that's awful world
so hey we're supposed to talk for like 15 minutes or 25 minutes to like that and get and stuff<$>oh yes yes we get free we get free money
so yes not yes but sometimes if they change their part and all the hit let's see a list<$>like it hit southern florida a lot more than like up north hotel last season
but yeah we didn't end up going but i don't know that i could deal with the cold up there in the winter<$>oh oh it's called here
they're expensive if you want them done rayna<$>well that's why one of the reasons, that's why the tattoo conventions are nice
well maybe you should get another one<$>well i did, i got mars and then mars ended up just being too wild

how is he excited about moving<$>oh yeah he is unfortunately
running the computer systems for the econ department<$>well what did you go to grad school for
