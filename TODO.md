# TODO (April 1st, 2025)

 - DATA : 
  - check pause symbols in SUMMRE benchmark (and more)
  - continue to check CANDOR (long-term usability)... 
  one solution could be to put CANDOR in pretraining and keep SWITCHBOARD for benchmark (we have SWITCHBOARD sound files)
 - CODE : 
  - clean redundant hard coded discourse benchmark creation
